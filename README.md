# prp21pdf

prp21pdf is a bash script with a sequence of standard GNU/Linux terminal commands which is able to merge all pdfs links in the OIST PRP web pages into one single pdf called fullprp.pdf.

Besides, a .txt version of this fullprp.pdf is created for ease of comparison offline or using the tools that Github provides.

The script runs everyday at 3am unnattended using a cron job. A version of the prp is freezed and stored in the folder every Wednesday.


UPDATE (2019/04/13):
The script worked since 2017/11/22 to 2019/03/20. The last "Wednesday" backup of the PRP was done correctly on March 20, 2019. The copies made the following days were not made correctly.

On April 13, 2019 the script mading the backup was stopped indefinitely.
