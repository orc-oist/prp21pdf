# prp21pdf

prp21pdf is a bash script with a sequence of standard GNU/Linux terminal commands which is able to merge all pdfs links in the OIST PRP web pages into one single pdf called fullprp.pdf.

Besides, a .txt version of this fullprp.pdf is created for ease of comparison offline or using the tools that Github provides.

The script runs everyday at 3am unnattended using a cron job. A version of the prp is freezed and stored in the folder every Wednesday.
