# prp21pdf

prp21pdf is a bash script with a sequence of standard GNU/Linux terminal commands which is able to merge all pdfs links in the OIST PRP web pages into one single pdf called fullprp.pdf.

Besides, a .txt version of this fullprp.pdf is created for ease of comparison offline or using the tools that Github provides.

The script runs everyday at 3am unnattended using a cron job. A version of the prp is freezed and stored in the folder every Wednesday.


UPDATE (2019/04/13):
The script worked since 2017/11/22 to 2019/03/20. The last "Wednesday" backup of the PRP was done correctly on March 20, 2019. The copies made the following days are broken.

The link in https://groups.oist.jp/orc/orc-oist-prp to this github repository was dissapeared.

On April 13th 2019, the prp21pdf (PRP to one pdf file) script was stopped indefinitely.
