Chapter 0. ABOUT THE POLICIES, RULES &
PROCEDURES LIBRARY
0.1 Overview
Policies are broad statements of principle that provide context and support for
the attitudes and conduct expected of the Okinawa Institute of Science and
Technology School Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “School
Corporation”) community. From policies flow “rules,” which state what is
encouraged, permitted, or forbidden. From rules flow procedures, the stepby-step instructions that implement the rules.
The Polices, Rules and Procedures (PRP) Chapters found in this PRP Library
provide the framework and directions for working and conducting other
transactions within School Corporation. The Library contains the
administrative and operating requirements of the University, as well as the

Operating Officer (hereinafter referred to as “COO”) [link: 2.4.6.2], which
oversees development of new and revised chapters and maintains the website,

Each PRP chapter is intended to help faculty, students and staff (and in some
cases, visitors, vendors and others) with policy guidance and rules, as well as
clear “how to” instructions for accessing School Corporation services and
complying with School Corporation requirements.
Because many of the policies, rules, and procedures in the Library have
general applicability, this online PRP Library is accessible to the community
outside School Corporation. Visitors, guests, vendors, and others who may be
1

Policies, Rules & Procedures

Approved by the President
OIST School Corporation Act

Chapter 1. WHO WE ARE:
Founding and Governing Principles

1.1
FOUNDING OF THE OIST GRADUATE UNIVERSITY
The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Promotion Corporation
(OIST PC) was established on September 1, 2005, pursuant to the
Independent Administrative Institution Okinawa Institute of Science and
Technology Promotion Corporation Act (Act No. 26 of 2005), in order to
prepare the way for an international graduate university (the University)
dedicated to science and technology. Following the successful establishment
and operation of OIST PC, the OIST School Corporation Act (Act No. 76 of
2009) was enacted to provide the institutional basis for the University and to
establish a framework for transitioning from a research institute to a fully
functioning graduate university.
The express objectives of the OIST School Corporation (OIST SC) are to
conduct outstanding international research and education in science and
technology, and by this means to:
~contribute to the sustainable development of Okinawa; and
~to advance science and technology in Japan and the rest of the world.
1.1.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE OIST GRADUATE UNIVERSITY
The founding documents established five central concepts to guide the
University:
Best in the World - Be a leading center for education and
research, which requires a culture where creativity, uniqueness, and
diversity are encouraged.
International – Aim that more than half of the faculty and
students will be non-Japanese and that English, as the international
language of science and technology, will be the University’s official
language.
Flexible – Encourage innovation, creativity, and adaptability
(academically and administratively), accommodate new initiatives,
establish an interdisciplinary academic structure, and treat every
student as a unique individual.
Global Networking – Increase research and education
opportunities and enhance the visibility of the University through
1
ch01_who-we-are_20151028_jp_cl

hosting, attending at and participating in international meetings,
conferences, workshops, collaborations, and the like.
Collaboration with Industry – Recognize that the research
outcomes generated by the University’s research in science and
technology may be developed and applied by industry for the benefit of
society in general as well as to facilitate sustainable development of
Okinawa and the competitiveness of Japan.
1.1.2 SCHOOL CORPORATION & UNIVERSITY
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
In keeping with the mandate of the OIST School Corporation Act, OIST
SC and the University present a unified management structure:
The ultimate authority and responsibility for the management
and operation of the OIST SC is vested in its Board of Governors (BOG).
The BOG selects a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for OIST SC, and the
CEO also serves as the President of the University. The BOG entrusts
the day-to-day management of the University to the President.
Additionally, the BOG appoints the Senior Level Executive, who is also
the Vice-CEO.
The President, in consultation with the BOG, establishes a
management structure for the University, a structure which is to be an
efficient and effective vehicle for operating a distinguished
international graduate university and which will ensure transparency
and accountability in its administrative and fiscal operations.

1.2

MISSION STATEMENT

The University shall conduct internationally outstanding education and
research in science and technology, and thus contribute to the sustainable
development of Okinawa, and promote and sustain the advancement of
science and technology in Japan and throughout the world.

1.3

CORE VALUES

Integrity, honesty, fairness, respect for others, and dedication to the OIST
mission are the values that inform the activities and behaviors of individuals
working for, or asserting an affiliation with, the University. The University
promotes diversity and provides equal opportunities for all community
members without regard for race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry,
physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, gender, sexual
orientation, or age.
2
ch01_who-we-are_20151028_jp_cl

In addition, the University operates within the principles established by the
following policies:
1.3.1

OPENNESS IN RESEARCH

The University’s central functions of teaching, learning, researching,
and publishing depend upon an atmosphere in which freedom of
inquiry, thought, expression, scholarship and peaceable assembly are
given full protection and support. Therefore, it is University policy that
expression of the widest range of viewpoints is to be encouraged within
the University.
In order to support the open and free exchange of ideas, the University
as a matter of policy also encourages participation in the research
enterprise by a diverse body of highly qualified individuals. Except in
extraordinary circumstances as determined by the President [link:
2.4.1], participation in University research by otherwise qualified
individuals will not be limited by citizenship, nationality, or
ethnicity. Similarly, participants in University research shall not be
denied access - based on citizenship, nationality, or ethnicity - to the
intellectually significant portions of their research.
Additionally, because the University’s research is intended for
dissemination within the interested scientific community and
throughout the world, only time-limited publication and disclosure
restrictions based on contractual and/or legal obligations, such as those
required for purposes of peer review and patentability review, may be
imposed on the research.

1.3.2

RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE

OIST Graduate University Respectful Workplace Policy
The University is committed to providing a work environment that
promotes education, research, and productivity through working
relationships based on respectful communication. This commitment
calls for a workplace where the following core values are upheld:
1. Everyone at OIST without exception has an important
contribution to make toward the overall success of the
University’s mission.
2. This mission will be carried out in an atmosphere where all
employees, in all types of jobs, value each other and treat each
3
ch01_who-we-are_20151028_jp_cl

other with respect. Communication between employees should
be polite at all times. This will be true even in situations of high
pressure and urgency.
3. Diversity among employees is celebrated at OIST and employees
must at all times exercise tolerance and respect for cultural,
gender, ethnic and other differences. Special consideration
should be given to those employees with physical or mental
impairment.
4. Managers, supervisors and others in positions of authority
should consider themselves as role models in the promotion of
these core values, without in any way abdicating their
responsibility to direct their employees to perform work
effectively.
5. In the same spirit, employees, irrespective of their job title, are
encouraged to discuss issues of concern without fear that those
discussions will result in negative treatment or punitive
consequences from any other employee of the University.
6. To promote mutual understanding and avoid unnecessary
conflicts, an atmosphere where native English speakers are
considerate of non-native speakers, and vice versa, is expected
so that no language-related barrier restricts employees from
participating in discussions or in asking questions.
7. In response to staff input, the University will make reasonable
changes to improve the work environment and productivity at
OIST.
1.3.3

COMMITMENT TO STUDENTS

The University’s PhD program is at the heart of the University, and its
participants are selected from the very best science and technology
graduate students in the world. The University is committed to their
success, both while in the thesis program and beyond. During their
graduate training at the University, each student will work closely with
world-class faculty pursuing unique, highly individualized programs of
study in modern well-equipped laboratories.
The University’s
international composition and interdisciplinary approach has been
expressly designed to spark exploration, creativity, discussion and
innovation, in order to assure that our students will advance the cutting
edge of research in science and technology. By providing excellent
conditions for thesis research (including good practical support for
living and thriving in Okinawa), the University advances the goals of its
4
ch01_who-we-are_20151028_jp_cl

students and encourages them to become tomorrow’s leaders.

1.4

UNIVERSITY CODE OF CONDUCT

The Code of Conduct (Code) is a statement of our shared and mutual
commitment to upholding ethical, professional and legal standards in
conducting our lives and making decisions within the University community.
The University values integrity, honesty, fairness, diversity, respect for others,
and equality of opportunity; it strives to assure that no activity of the
University undermines fundamental principles of human dignity.
As
members of the University community, all faculty, staff, students, University
officers, members of the Board of Governors, and all University affiliates and
volunteers are responsible for maintaining and demonstrating these values
and for observing the ethical standards of both the University and the broader
community in which it operates. The values contained in this Code of Conduct
must be integral elements of the University’s educational, research and
business practices. Each of us also must be cognizant of, and comply with, the
relevant external policies, standards, laws and regulations that pertain to our
activities.

1.4.1
APPLICABILITY
The University’s Code applies to the following members of the University
community:
~ Those who are paid by the University when they are working for
the University, including faculty, staff, researchers and students;
~ Those doing business with the University, such as consultants,
vendors, and contractors;
~ Those who perform services for the University as volunteers; and
~ Those who assert an association with the University (such as
alumni).
1.4.2
BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS & OTHER ACTIVITIES
Members of the community must transact University business in
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and University policies,
rules, and procedures. Business transactions and other activities within
the University may not always be subject to specific laws, regulations, or
codes of ethics. In these instances, our core values will govern. The fact
that a particular business or other practice is common, customary, or
expedient will not justify its use at the University if that practice conflicts
with the core values of the University or any other the requirements of
the Code.
5
ch01_who-we-are_20151028_jp_cl

1.4.3
PROTECTION OF INFORMATION
Community members receive and generate on behalf of the University
various types of confidential, proprietary, and private information. It is
imperative that each member of the University community understands
and complies with Japanese law concerning access to and disclosure of
various types of information. In addition, each member of the University
community must comply with disclosure/nondisclosure agreements with
third parties, and with University policies, rules and procedures [link:
12] pertaining to the use, protection and disclosure of such information.
Be aware that, in some cases, these rules and procedures may continue
to apply even after a person’s relationship with the University has ended.
1.4.4
CONFLICT OF INTEREST/CONFLICT OF
COMMITMENT
Members of the University community who serve as faculty or staff owe
their primary professional allegiance to the University and its mission.
Outside professional activities, private financial interests, or the receipt
of benefits from third parties can cause an actual or perceived divergence
between an individual’s private interests and the duty of allegiance to the
University.
To help prevent such a potential conflict of interest or commitment
(including the appearance of a conflict) from arising, faculty and staff
who have other professional or financial interests shall disclose them in
compliance with applicable conflict of interest/conflict of commitment
policies and procedures set out in the Policies, Rules and Procedures
Library at Chapter 22, Avoiding Conflicts of Interest & Commitment.

9
ch02_governance-organization_en_20180601_cl

2.6 CEO/President’s Delegation of Authority
As authorized by the Board of Governors, the President/CEO may delegate
executive management and administrative authority to the University's Senior
Level Executives. The CEO/President's delegations of authority authorize the
Senior Level Executives to act on behalf of the Corporation/University in the
name of the CEO/President and to bind the Corporation/University within the
scope of the delegated authority to a legally enforceable obligation. The
CEO/President may condition, limit, or revoke any authorities so delegated at
any time. Authority reserved by the CEO/President may not be exercised by
any other person.
Delegation of authority does not permit those so privileged to violate spending
or signature thresholds established by the CEO/President for fiscal and
administrative control.
2.6.1 Sub-Delegations of the CEO/President's Authority.
Senior Executives who have authorities delegated to them by the
CEO/President may, but need not, sub-delegate authorities to
employees who report to them and so on throughout the organization.
The Senior Executives are ultimately responsible and accountable for the
proper sub-delegation of the CEO/President's authorities throughout
their units, in accordance with this policy. For purposes of this Chapter,
the person who delegates authority to others is a “Delegating Official”
and the person who receives a delegation of authority is a “Delegate.”
2.6.2 Responsibilities of Delegates
2.6.2.1 Delegates may further delegate any delegated authority if
it is not expressly disallowed or limited in any way. However,
unless further delegation is required, delegates may reserve to
themselves any authority delegated to them.
2.6.2.2 Delegates below the level of Vice President must obtain
approval from the Delegating Official in order to sub-delegate any
authority delegated to them.
2.6.2.3 Delegates may not delegate greater responsibility and
decision-making authority than they have been delegated, and
may not delegate authority to anyone who has an individual or
institutional conflict of interest related to that authority, as
defined by University policy [link: 22].
2.6.2.4 Employees with delegated authority must act only within
the scope of that delegation. Employees who act outside the scope
10
ch02_governance-organization_en_20180601_cl

of their authority and do not have documented authority to do so
may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.
2.6.2.5 Delegates remain responsible and accountable at all times
for the exercise of any authority they choose to sub-delegate to
others.
2.6.3 Requirements for Delegation
2.6.3.1 Delegated authority must be granted and exercised
consistent with the terms and conditions of the original
delegation and with all applicable laws and University policies.
2.6.3.2 Delegating Officials must delegate authority only to
persons who are current University employees, who have some
level of responsibility for the activity being conducted, who are
knowledgeable about University policies, rules, laws, regulations
and procedures, and over whom the Delegating Official has
management authority. All delegations become null and void
upon the last date of employment.
2.6.3.3 Delegating Officials must provide copies of their
delegations of authority (new or revised) to the COO and to the
General Counsel.
2.6.3.4 For annual budget authority, a delegation of authority is
deemed complete once the budget is allocated on the ERP system.
Any other delegation of authority must be made in writing.
2.6.3.5 Delegating Officials must retain documentation of all of
their delegations, and review those delegations at least annually,
via the performance evaluation process, to ensure they are up-todate and appropriate. This documentation must be made
available upon request.
2.6.4. Ambiguities involving Delegations of Authority. In the
event that there is an ambiguity or an inconsistency involving delegation
assignments, the CEO/President or his/her delegate will determine who
has the ultimate authority.
2.7 Use & Management of Seals
2.7.1 Official Seals – The Official Seals are the seals to signify
authenticity of contracts, agreements, and other official documents of the
11
ch02_governance-organization_en_20180601_cl

Corporation or the University by affixing their seal impressions, and their
use is limited to that purpose. Typical examples include the official seals
of;
⚫ OIST School Corporation
⚫ CEO of OIST School Corporation
⚫ OIST Graduate University
⚫ President of OIST Graduate University
In addition, official seals for internal organizations or their heads may be
developed as necessary.
2.7.2 Production and Custody – Any of University/Corporation’s
official seals shall be produced by the COO and registered in a registry
(Official Seal Registry) developed and maintained by the COO. The seals
are in the custody of the COO or the officials that are registered in the
Official Seal Registry with an approval of the COO. Any official seals shall
be kept with utmost care in accordance with the guidelines developed by
the COO.
2.7.3 Use of Seals – Official seals shall be affixed by an employee
registered in the registry only after carefully confirming the documents are
authorized by the President/CEO or the authorized delegate.
2.7.3.1 Copy of Seal Impression – With a prior approval by the COO,
the impression of official seals may be copied or electronically
inserted, when issuing standardized documents, such as ID cards
and certifications or issuing a large number of documents with the
same contents.
2.7.3.2 Signatures – When making a document written only in
English and used in business transactions, such as making contracts
or agreements, with entities outside of Japan, a signature may be
used to verify the authenticity of the document in substitution for
official seals.

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules & Procedures
Authority:
⚫ Approved by the President
⚫ School Education Act
Chapter 3. Faculty Handbook
3.1 Policy
The OIST Graduate University Faculty Handbook describes policies governing
the faculty, including teaching, research, appointments, promotion, and
governance. The Dean of Faculty Affairs is responsible for implementation of
University policy regarding appointments and promotions, salary setting,
sabbaticals, grievances, and other general matters concerning the faculty. The
Dean of Faculty Affairs ensures compliance with policies set by the Board of
Governors and Faculty Council, maintains the Faculty Handbook and faculty
records, works with OIST Graduate University (the “University”) officers and
committees to develop new policy, and responds to external reporting requests.
3.2 Faculty Assignment
3.2.1 Composition of Faculty
Consistent with the principles outlined in the section on the “Purpose
and Necessity of Establishment,” the University will work toward
“best in the world” status by appointing outstanding faculty members.
The aim of being “international” will be supported by ensuring that at
least half of the faculty members are from outside Japan, and by
attracting faculty members with strongly international experience and
perspective. The overall ratio of faculty to students will be about 1:3.
All faculty members will be expected to teach in English.
Faculty will be expected to maintain a program of excellent research
and publication, to participate in the teaching program of the
Graduate University, to supervise graduate research projects, and to
assume appropriate responsibilities in the University academic
community. The full-time faculty will be composed of Professors,
Associate Professors and Assistant Professors, all of whom have
independent research programs, teach in the Graduate University,
and supervise doctoral research.
In addition to the full-time appointments, adjunct
faculty appointments may be made to fill special needs that cannot
be filled at the time with a full-time appointment. Adjunct
appointments may be made in connection with collaborative
research project or external research project. Adjunct
appointments also may be made during transition periods for
incoming professors before they can begin full-time work at OIST,
1
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

and for outgoing professors to complete ongoing research and
educational supervision.
Appointments of Adjunct faculty at OIST are exceptional. They do
not constitute a customary or required element of the faculty. The
total number of Adjunct appointments should not exceed ~10% of
the full-time faculty, excluding those in transition. Adjunct
appointments are for a fixed term not exceeding five years and in
general under a non-employee relationship, not exceeding 25%-time
commitment. Adjunct faculty members will have research units
with reduced resources in proportion to the scale of their
appointment. Adjunct Faculty are eligible to and encouraged to
seek additional, external funding.
An appointment of an Adjunct Professor may be proposed by the
President, the Deans, or the Chair of the Faculty Assembly. Upon
approval by the President, a Search Committee is formed and a
recruiting process is initiated.
The approved candidate consults with the Dean of the Graduate
School and the Dean of Faculty Affairs to prepare a plan for research,
teaching, and academic service with appropriate scope and content.
The application will be reviewed according to standard procedures
described in PRP 3.2.4. The criteria for appointment are described
in PRP 3.2.4.3(d). Based on the recommendation of the Search
Committee, the President makes a final decision on the appointment.
With approval of the President, Adjunct appointments may be
renewed.
Review of Adjunct faculty units will follow the standard unit review
process [link: PRP 3.2.4.5] and will be completed by the end of the
penultimate year of the appointment.
Visiting Professors and Sabbatical Visitors (link to Procedure for
Applying for a Sabbatical Visitor) will have external appointments in
other universities. They will not have independent laboratory
resources at the University, but will spend significant time at OIST.
Visiting Professors will contribute by directing or assisting in teaching
University courses, contributing to University international
workshops, and participating in collaborative research. Visiting
faculty members will not be primary Thesis Supervisors but may serve
on Thesis Committees.
Distinguished Professors are internationally recognized researchers
who hold or have held senior professorial positions in other
Universities or institutions.
The definition of Emeritus Professor is stipulated in 3.3.1.
3.2.2 Faculty Teaching Assignment
The University is dedicated to excellence in research and education.
Access to opportunities to develop and coordinate a course is
2
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

important for the professional development of faculty members
because scholarship and teaching are the primary factors in
evaluation for promotion and tenure. While the quality of teaching is
paramount an evenly distributed teaching load is also important to
ensure that all staff can achieve and demonstrate excellence in a
sufficient amount of teaching and that individual staff members do
not carry excessive teaching loads.
The Dean of the Graduate School will assign faculty members to be
Course Coordinators, and determine which faculty members
contribute to each course. The Course Coordinators will be
responsible for overseeing the content, teaching, and examination
requirements of the course. Faculty will be expected to have a deep
knowledge of the area covered by the syllabus of the courses they
coordinate.
Guidelines for teaching assignment
1. All full-time faculty members are expected to teach one approved
graduate course per year (two credits per year). If faculty members
share teaching of a course their point contribution can be calculated
pro rata. For example, the two credits could be achieved by coteaching two courses, or teaching two courses of one credit.
2. The teaching expectation of adjunct faculty members is
proportional to their time commitment to the University. For
example, an adjunct faculty member with 50% commitment to the
University is expected to contribute one-credit.
3. The credit loading may be amortized over two years provided the
overall teaching commitment of the University in any given year is
realized.
4. Faculty members are encouraged to go beyond minimum
requirements for educational reasons and faculty may use additional
time to teach a course if they so wish, provided that this can be
accommodated in the student timetable. However, teaching longer
in a course does not contribute additional credits.
5. We have a commitment and an obligation to MEXT to deliver
teaching by accredited faculty members. Abdication of teaching
responsibilities is viewed seriously. The opportunity to enhance
teaching by participation of visiting professors is recognized but
certain guidelines apply.
Substitute teachers may not be used to deliver the faculty
commitment, except under the sabbatical leave regulations. Guest
lectures by visiting faculty are welcome but require prior approval by
the Dean of the Graduate School, based on confirmation that the
teaching content and methods will fulfill the course objectives.
Applications must be submitted at least one month prior to the
3
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

scheduled teaching on form [link: TBD].
6. With the agreement of the Deans of the Graduate School and
Faculty Affairs, non-faculty researchers (Postdoctoral Scholars, Staff
Scientists, Research Specialists and Science and Technology
Associates) [link: ] may contribute to courses under the supervision
of a faculty member. Non-faculty researchers may not be the
principal supervisor of graduate students, but may assist in
supervising their research assignments. If such members of the
research staff are engaged in teaching, it should be connected with
their project and enhance their academic development, and be
recorded by the graduate school. In such cases it is expected that the
University faculty member is present for the scheduled teaching
hours to provide mentoring and quality control; this should not be
used to replace faculty in teaching. Measures of performance of nonfaculty researchers may include the contribution to teaching. Non
faculty members wishing to teach should consult the relevant section
of the Graduate School Handbook.
7. Other teaching and administrative responsibilities do not offset the
baseline
faculty
teaching
expectation.
Other
teaching
responsibilities include service as Academic Mentors, on
Committees including the Admissions Committee and the
Curriculum and Examinations Committee, supervision of PhD
Thesis Research, Supervision of Rotations, and Supervision of
Research Interns etc.
3.2.3 Research Units
The Research Unit is the administrative entity for managing faculty
research at the University. All full-time faculty members including
Assistant Professors will be independent heads of Research Units. The
non-hierarchical organization of the faculty and the absence of
departmental structure will encourage interaction between Research
Units and sharing of space, equipment, and expertise, which will
promote interdisciplinary research activities. Research Units may
appoint Postdoctoral Scholars, Staff Scientists, Research Specialists
or Technicians [link:] as fixed term employees. For continuing
appointments, the Unit Head may make a proposal to the Continuing
Staff Appointments Committee [link to CSAC-14-N001-V1.3]. Staff
Scientists and Research Specialists may be nominated as Group
Leaders. Postdoctoral Scholars are always fixed term employees.
Administrative personnel will be appointed according to the
administrative needs of the Research Units, and may be shared
between different Research Units. Faculty members have a high level
of responsibility when employing fixed term research staff to ensure
that their training and career development needs are taken into
account.
3.2.3.1 Non-Faculty Research Appointments
There are five classes of non-Faculty Research Appointments;
Postdoctoral Scholars [link:], Staff Scientists [link:], Research
4
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

Specialists [link: ], Technicians [link: ] and Science and Technology
Associates [link: ]. Non-faculty research staff may undertake limited
teaching duties as described in 3.2.2 item 6. The definition of each
non-Faculty Research Appointment is stipulated in 4.2.
3.2.4 Recruitment and New Appointment
Faculty members of the University are selected based on the highest
international standards of evaluation of candidates to ensure the
recruitment of the best available faculty. The procedures are described
in the Faculty Search Committee Handbook.
The entire appointment proceedings require discussion of specific
individuals, and the opinions of others regarding those individuals.
This and other relevant information must be held in strict confidence
by all participants. The University commits to extensive measures to
protect the privacy of the candidates by preserving the confidentiality
of the information it receives regarding the candidates
3.2.4.1
Strategies for Recruiting the Best Available Faculty
The University will recruit faculty through open competition and
strict review with the highest academic and research standards,
expressly including external evaluation. To attract world-class
researchers, the University will need to provide an excellent research
environment. An important consideration is internal funding.
Funding is provided for each Research Unit based on a five-year
approved budget plan, adjusted annually to conform to the actual
budget and changes that may have occurred in the Unit. Faculty
members also will be encouraged to seek external funding. To attract
world-class researchers, the University will offer salaries, travel
expenses, and other benefits that are competitive with top universities
in other countries.
3.2.4.2 Age and Gender Distribution of the Research and
Teaching Staff
The University’s recruiting policies will aim for a balance in the age
distribution of the University faculty. This will ensure that both new
researchers and more established researchers will be represented
among the faculty. The University is an equal opportunity employer
and is committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty. The
University welcomes nominations of and applications from women
and members of underrepresented groups, as well as others who
would bring additional dimensions to the University’s research,
teaching and commercial development missions.
3.2.4.3 New Appointment
The University will use standard tiered ranks of appointment enabling
smooth transfer of personnel between institutions and enhancing
recruitment at appropriate levels to maintain world-best standards of
faculty teaching and research. This will consist of a tenure-track
system comprising Assistant Professors, Associate Professors and
Professors. Appointments may be made at any of these levels. Tenure
5
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

carries with it a commitment of employment until retirement.
However, it does not guarantee internal research support. Tenured
faculty will compete along with their fellow tenured and untenured
faculty colleagues for internal research funding on a 5-year cycle.
For an appointment, the evaluation and recommendation phase is
carried out by a Faculty Search Committee.
a) Process of Determining Rank and Tenure Status at New
Appointment
Appointments follow a rigorous process of evaluation and
recommendation from among the following ranks,
- Assistant Professor is an untenured position.
- Associate Professor is an untenured position at initial appointment
in general, but under exceptional circumstances can be made with
tenure.
- Professor is normally the position denoting tenure, although there
may be some situations where this is not the case, such as when the
individual is beyond the retirement age.
b) Structure and Membership of the Faculty Search
Committee
The Faculty Search Committee is responsible for gathering data on
scholarship, teaching, and other relevant matters. The Faculty Search
Committee will comprise three to five members of the Faculty
Assembly. The Dean of Faculty Affairs will appoint Faculty Search
Committee members and the Chair. Faculty Search Committees may
include external members, but the Chair should be from the Faculty
Assembly. Members of the Senior Level Executives should not
normally be members of Faculty Search Committees.
A member of the Faculty Search Committee will be assigned the
responsibility of insuring that the diversity standards for the search
are met.
c) Criteria for New Appointment
Both scholarship and teaching are important prerequisites for faculty
appointments because the University is dedicated to excellence in both.
The purpose of the appointment evaluation of the candidate is to
appraise, on the basis of the record to date, the standing and potential
in the relevant scholarly discipline, broadly defined, and the quality of
teaching and mentoring.
The Faculty Search Committee will select candidates considered for
possible appointment. The Faculty Search Committee will solicit
advice from external advisor(s) about standing of the chosen
candidates, and suggest external reviewers (letter writers) who will
write letters for the candidates. Letters from external reviewers (letter
writers) are essential for an objective process and, in general, carry
more weight than letters from reviewers of candidate’s choice. The
6

Faculty Search Committee aims to collect 4 letters from external
reviewers (letter writers) for appointment at the untenured level and
8 letters from external reviewers (letter writers) for tenure
appointments, within 2 months from the initial request for the letters.
If 25% of the letters at this point recommend non-appointment, it will
require some other justification to make the recommendation to
appoint. The external reviewers (letter writers) should neither be coauthors, mentors nor close working colleagues of the candidate. When
soliciting the opinion of internal or external reviewers (letter writers),
the Faculty Search Committee should use the sample letters of request
from the Faculty Search Committee Handbook.
The first criterion for an appointment is that the individual's
scholarship and research ranks among the top 5-10 percent in their
world-wide cohort at his or her level of professional development for
the proposed appointment level. Letters from external reviewers
(letter writers) should support this assessment in an unequivocal
fashion.
The second criterion for appointment is a record of high quality
teaching that clearly establishes that the candidate can plan and
sustain a quality teaching program. Given that some candidates
(especially for appointment to the Assistant Professor rank) may not
yet have had an opportunity to teach extensively, the Faculty Search
Committee must assess whether the candidate has the potential to be
a qualified instructor at the University. Teaching is broadly defined to
include the classroom or laboratory, advising, mentoring, program
building, and curriculum development. If available, evidence and
testimonials of the teaching record should be included in the file.
The outcome of the Faculty Search Committee will be a file containing
the Appointment Papers and a cover letter from the Chair submitted
to the President, after review by the Appointment and Promotion
Committee as described in the Faculty Search Committee Handbook,
through the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
When a Faculty Search Committee process results in a positive
recommendation for tenured appointments, there will be the
following levels of review that are required in order to achieve
ratification. Taken in order they are:
1) Review by the President.
2) If the President agrees with the recommendation by the Faculty
Search Committee, the file, accompanied by a letter from the
President, goes to the Board of Governors for final approval.
3) If the President disagrees with the Committee recommendation,
the President will discuss how to resolve the disagreement with
the Committee. He/She may convene a separate assessment for own
use if necessary.

3.2.5

Faculty Evaluation
Evaluations (Promotions Review and Tenure Review) follow a
rigorous process of evaluation, recommendation and review. The
procedures are described in the Promotion Review Evaluation
Committee (PREC) Handbook and Tenure Review Evaluation
Committee (TREC) Handbook, respectively.
The entire Promotion Review and Tenure Review proceedings require
discussion of specific individuals, and the opinions of others regarding
those individuals. This and other relevant information must be held in
strict confidence by all participants. The University commits to
extensive measures to protect the privacy of the candidates by
preserving the confidentiality of the information it receives regarding
the candidates.

3.2.5.1.1 Promotion Review (Applicable to tenured Associate
Professors)
Associate Professor appointed with tenure will be reviewed for
promotion to Professor during Year 4 after tenure appointment. Early
review will be permitted in exceptional circumstances.
a) Structure and Membership of Promotion Review
Evaluation Committee (PREC)
For a promotion review, the evaluation and recommendation phase is
carried out by a Promotion Review Evaluation Committee (PREC).
The PREC will comprise three to five members of the Faculty
Assembly. The Dean of Faculty Affairs will appoint PREC members
and the Chair. The PREC may include external advisors, but the Chair
should be from the Faculty Assembly. Details are described in the
corresponding PREC Handbook.
The PREC is a non-standing committee that is established
independently for each individual action. In evaluation, substantial
input from external reviewers (letter writers) is required and the
external reviewer (letter writer) input carries the most weight with
regard to the final evaluation.
b) Outline of Promotion Review
8
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

The PREC has the responsibility for gathering data on scholarship,
teaching, service and other relevant matters.
Members of the PREC should have no collaborative or mentoring
relationship with the candidate, although this may sometimes be
unavoidable or preferable to other alternatives. Any mentoring or
collaborative relationship between the candidate and a PREC member
should be clearly disclosed in the cover letter from the Chair.
Letters from external reviewers (letter writers) are essential for an
objective evaluation process and, in general, carry more weight than
letters from reviewers of candidate’s choice. The PREC aims to collect
6 letters from external reviewers (letter writers) within 2 months from
the initial request of the letters. If 25% of the letters at this point
recommend non-promotion, the case needs to be carefully
reconsidered. The external reviewers (letter writers) should neither be
co-authors, mentors nor close working colleagues of the candidate.
When soliciting the opinion of external reviewers (letter writers), the
PREC should draft the letter requesting the evaluation based on the
template in the PREC Handbook.
A member of the PREC should be assigned the responsibility of
insuring that the diversity standards for the promotion review
evaluation are met.
c) Criteria for Promotion
The criteria for promotion concern the performance in scholarship,
teaching and service while at OIST.
Scholarship: The first criterion for promotion is that the individual's
scholarship and research ranks among the top 5 or 10 percent in their
world-wide cohort at his or her level of professional development for
the proposed promotion level. The appraisal of the scholarship will be
based on the letters received from the external reviewers (letter
writers), and on the quality of the three nominated papers for review,
and their impact and originality. Letters from external reviewers
(letter writers) should support this assessment in an unequivocal
fashion.
Teaching and mentoring: The second criterion for promotion is a
record of high quality teaching that clearly establishes that the
candidate can plan and sustain a quality teaching program. The
appraisal of teaching performance will be based mainly on the
experience at OIST. Teaching is defined to include the classroom and
laboratory, as well as advising, mentoring, program building, and
curricular development. In evaluating teaching, testimonials from
students, postdoctoral scholars and OIST faculty will be important. As
part of the CV and Academic Service Record, the candidate can
provide relevant, yet objective, feedback from students attending
courses presented by the candidate, and/or examples of mentoring
9
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

practice. The Dean of the Graduate School and others may be
consulted for an appraisal.
Academic Service: Supporting the University in its widest sense
through committees and other service work, and the international
scientific community through, for example, service on conference
organizing committees, editorial boards and peer review committees
is an important part of the academic duties. The Dean of Research, the
Dean of Faculty Affairs and others (for example, Committee Chairs)
may be consulted for an appraisal.
There is no fixed weighting of these aspects. However, excellence in
scholarship and teaching is required, and the performance in service
work must be, at least, assessed as good. It will not be possible to be
promoted if the performance in either teaching or service work is
unsatisfactory.
d) Process after Promotion Review
The PREC recommendation will be a file containing Promotion
Review papers and a cover letter from the Chair of the PREC,
submitted to the President, after review by the Appointment and
Promotion Committee as described in the PREC Handbook, through
the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
A positive recommendation from the PREC will proceed through the
following levels of review. Taken in order, these are:
1) Review by the President
2) If the President agrees with the PREC recommendation, the file,
accompanied by a letter from the President, goes to the Board of
Governors for final approval.
3) If the President disagrees with the PREC recommendation, the
President will discuss how to resolve the disagreement with the
PREC. He/She may convene a separate assessment for own use if
necessary.
A negative PREC recommendation with which the President concurs,
will be sent to the candidate, and will also be reported to the Board of
Governors.
No review for promotion will be undertaken for at least 3 years.
3.2.5.1.2 Appeal Process
The purpose of the appeal process is to determine whether the
promotion review procedures were correctly followed. The Appeal
Process itself is not a reevaluation of the decision. The grounds for an
appeal are limited to determining whether there were procedural
errors (such as the failure to bring proper facts and criteria to bear on
a decision, or the introduction of improper facts and criteria, or the
failure to follow procedures correctly) that substantially affected the
outcome. An unsuccessful candidate who believes there was a
procedural error in the promotion review can file an appeal with the
Dean of Faculty Affairs within ten (10) business days from receipt of
10
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

the failure notice. Detailed appeal documents, if any, should be
submitted within one month of registering the appeal.
When an appeal is filed, the matter is automatically referred to the
Dean of Research and the Dean of the Graduate School to select an
ad-hoc Appeal Committee comprised of tenured faculty. If the Appeal
Committee finds that there were procedural errors that substantially
affected the outcome, the Appeal Committee may recommend actions
to correct the errors. The details of the corrective actions will depend
on the nature of the procedural errors, but may involve a new PREC,
new external reviewers (letter writers), new letters, or other
changes. If the Appeal Committee finds that there were no
procedural errors that affected the outcome, the recommendation will
be to dismiss the appeal. The Appeal Committee, itself has no
authority to recommend or deny promotion.
The recommendation of the Appeal Committee is final and is
communicated in writing to the President and to the candidate who
filed the appeal within 2 months from registering the appeal. The
candidate may not challenge the outcome of the appeal. If further
actions are recommended by the Appeal Committee, it is the
responsibility of the President to implement those actions.
3.2.5.2.1 Tenure Review (A)
[Transitional Provision]
Tenure Review (A) is applicable to Assistant Professors and untenured
Associate Professors who were negotiated their contracts or appointed
as faculty members at OIST SC between November 1st 2011 and
December 31st 2016. However, they may choose Tenure Review (B) in
consultation with the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
The detailed information of the Tenure Review (A) can be referred to
the TREC Handbook Version 2.5. For Assistant Professors, a tenure
evaluation is conducted in Year 6. Untenured Associate Professors
will be evaluated for tenure in Year 4.
Scholarship and teaching are the primary factors in evaluation for
tenure because the University is dedicated to excellence in research
and education. Service to the University and/or the community is also
a relevant consideration. Scholarly distinction is especially important
because it sustains both the University's research and teaching
mission, which derives its strength from the ongoing involvement of
the instructors in research at the forefront of a field. The purpose of
the tenure evaluation is to appraise, on the basis of the record to date,
the standing and potential in the relevant scholarly discipline, quality
of teaching and mentoring, and quality and relevance of service.

The tenure decision is based on the career scholarly, teaching and
service achievement during the full career, not solely the achievements
at OIST.
11
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

The Tenure Review Evaluation Committee (TREC) has the
responsibility for gathering data on scholarship, teaching, service
and other relevant matters. The Dean of Faculty Affairs will appoint
the TREC members after discussion of potential membership and
possible external advisors with the candidate. The TREC will
comprise three to five members of the Faculty Assembly with
chair nominated by Dean of Faculty Affairs.
The TREC may enlist an external advisor to assist with identifying
suitable external reviewers (letter writers) and should include an
external member to assist in assessing the case for tenure, with full
membership of the TREC and voting rights.
Members of the TREC should have no collaborative or mentoring
relationship with the candidate, although this may sometimes be
unavoidable or preferable to other alternatives. Any mentoring or
collaborative relationship between the candidate and a TREC member
should be clearly disclosed in the cover letter from the Chair.
A member of the TREC should be assigned the responsibility of
insuring that the diversity standards for the tenure review evaluation
are met.
Letters from external reviewers (letter writers) are essential for an
objective evaluation. The TREC aims to collect 8 letters from external
reviewers (letter writers) within 2 months from the initial request for
letters. If 25% of those collected at this point recommend against
tenure, that should be sufficient to refuse tenure.
The external reviewers (letter writers) should neither be co-authors,
mentors nor close working colleagues of the candidate. When
soliciting the opinion of external reviewers (letter writers), the TREC
should draft the letter requesting the evaluation based on the
template in the TREC Handbook.
The first criterion for a tenure appointment is that the candidate has
achieved the highest level of distinction in scholarship and research
that places them within the top echelon of their international peer
group. The peer group comprises world-wide scholars that are at the
same level of academic maturity who work in research areas that are
similar or closely allied to that of the candidate. Letters from external
reviewers (letter writers) should support this assessment in an
unequivocal fashion.
The second criterion for a tenure appointment is a record of high
quality teaching that clearly establishes that the candidate can plan
and sustain a first-rate teaching program. Teaching is broadly defined
to include the classroom or laboratory, advising, mentoring, program
building, and curriculum development. A letter from the Dean of the
Graduate School is required to document and evaluate the teaching,
12
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

rotation supervision and mentoring roles.
In some cases, service to the University can be relevant to the tenure
decision. But service, however exemplary, cannot substitute for major
shortcomings in scholarship or teaching.
The outcome of the TREC will be a file containing the Tenure Review
Papers and a cover letter from the Chair of the TREC to the President,
after review by the Appointment and Promotion Committee as
described in the TREC Handbook Version 2.5, through the Dean of
Faculty Affairs.
The positive recommendation of the TREC will proceed through the
following levels of review. Taken in order they are:
1) Review by the President
2) If the President agrees with the recommendation by TREC, the
file, accompanied by a letter from the President, goes to the
Board of Governors for final approval.
3) If the President disagrees with the TREC recommendation, the
President will discuss how to resolve the disagreement with the
TREC. He/She may convene a separate assessment for own use
if necessary.
A negative TREC recommendation with which the President concurs,
will be sent to the candidate, and will also be reported to the Board of
Governors.
For an Assistant Professor, the award of tenure automatically involves
promotion to Associate Professor.
Under exceptional circumstances, an Assistant Professor who has
had a negative tenure outcome can be reviewed for promotion to
Associate Professor without tenure. In such exceptional case, the
second review as Associate Professor without tenure is conducted in
Year 8 from the initial appointment as an Assistant Professor and
follows the similar procedure stipulated in Tenure Review (B). Such
tenure review must be completed by the end of Year 9 from the initial
appointment as an Assistant Professor.
For an Associate Professor, TREC may solicit from the external
reviewers (letter writers) an opinion on whether to promote to
Professor and on the basis of the responses may make such a
recommendation.
In the case of a negative decision for tenure, the appointment will
terminate as in the contract, or after a year if the remaining time on
the contract is less than a year. The unsuccessful candidate should
work with the Dean of Research and the Dean of Faculty Affairs to
ensure an orderly transition, including making proper provision for
13
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

the timely completion of any theses that are in progress, for
redeployment of any continuing staff and for the completion of the
contracts for the fixed-term staff and post-doctoral scholars.
3.2.5.2.1 Tenure Review (B)
[Transitional Provision]
Tenure Review (B) is applicable to untenured faculty who negotiated
their contracts after January 1st, 2017.
The detailed information of the Tenure Review (B) can be referred to
the TREC Handbook.
a) Structure and Membership of Tenure Review Evaluation
Committee (TREC)
For a tenure review, the evaluation and recommendation phase is
carried out by the TREC. The TREC is made up of three to five external
members. The Dean of Faculty Affairs will appoint external TREC
members, with the advice from the Appointment and Promotion
Committee as described in the TREC Handbook Version 3.0 and after
discussion of potential membership with the candidate, and the Chair.
Members of the TREC should have no collaborative or mentoring
relationship with the candidate, although this may sometimes be
unavoidable or preferable to other alternatives. Any mentoring or
collaborative relationship between the candidate and a TREC member
should be clearly disclosed in the cover letter from the Chair.
A member of the TREC should be assigned the responsibility of
insuring that the diversity standards for the tenure review evaluation
are met.
The TREC is a non-standing committee that is established
independently for each individual action. In evaluation, substantial
input from external reviewer (letter writer) is required and the
external reviewer (letter writer) input carries the most weight with
regard to the final evaluation.
b) Outline of Tenure Review
The TREC has the responsibility for conducting on-site review,
analyzing letters from external reviewers (letter writers) and data on
scholarship, teaching, service and other relevant matters, and
finalizing a report during the on-site review.
The purpose of the tenure review is to appraise, on the basis of the
record to date, the standing and potential in the relevant scholarly
discipline, quality of teaching and mentoring, and quality and
relevance of service.
The tenure decision is based on the career scholarly, teaching and
service achievement during the full career, not solely the achievements
at OIST.

Evaluation Starting Date). If 25% of those collected at this point
recommend against tenure, that should be sufficient to refuse tenure.
The external reviewers (letter writers) should neither be co-authors,
mentors nor close working colleagues of the candidate. When
soliciting the opinion of external reviewers (letter writers), the TREC
should draft the letter requesting the evaluation based on the template
in the TREC Handbook.
c) Criteria for Tenure (same with TREC Review (A))
The first criterion for a tenure appointment is that the candidate has
achieved the highest level of distinction in scholarship and research
that places them within the top echelon of their international peer
group. The peer group comprises world-wide scholars that are at the
same level of academic maturity who work in research areas that are
similar or closely allied to that of the candidate. Letters from external
reviewers (letter writers) and the report from on-site review by the
TREC should support this assessment in an unequivocal fashion.
The second criterion for a tenure appointment is a record of high
quality teaching that clearly establishes that the candidate can plan
and sustain a first-rate teaching program. Teaching is broadly defined
to include the classroom or laboratory, advising, mentoring, program
building, and curriculum development. A letter from the Dean of the
Graduate School is required to document and evaluate the teaching,
rotation supervision and mentoring roles.
In some cases, service to the University can be relevant to the tenure
decision. But service, however exemplary, cannot substitute for major
shortcomings in scholarship or teaching.
d) Timeline of Tenure Review
Assistant Professor
The Tenure Review begins on or by the TESD, which is the last day of
the 6th month of Year 5 (4 years and 6 months after initial
appointment). The 1st Tenure Review of an Assistant Professor must
be completed by the end of Year 6. The TESD is the deadline for
receiving tenure materials from the candidate. The Tenure Review
15
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

decision will normally be made within 6 months of the TESD. The
TESD cannot be delayed, except for the circumstances in accordance
with the “Stop-the-Clock” Policy in PRP3.2.5.2.2. An early review will
be permitted in exceptional circumstances.
Year 1: Appointment as Assistant Professor begins. A Mentor is
appointed.
End of Year 3: The candidate, his/her mentor, and a tenured
Faculty member (appointed by the Dean of Faculty Affairs) meet to
write a status report about the candidate’s readiness for the tenure
review. The report will be submitted to the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
The candidate has a status meeting with the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
Between the mid-Year 5 and Year 6: The 1st Tenure Review is
conducted. By the end of Year 6, the Tenure Review must be
completed (The TREC’s recommendation is sent to the President and
the candidate is notified of the Tenure Review outcome by the
President). There are three possible outcomes:
• “Outstanding”: Assistant Professor is awarded tenure and
appointed as Professor with approval from the Board of Governors.
• “Satisfactory”: Assistant Professor is promoted to untenured
Associate Professor with approval from the President.
• “Unsuccessful”: The contract is terminated at the end of the
contract period, or one year from notification of the failed review,
whichever is later, subject to the limitation in PRP3.2.5.2.4.
Year 8: The 2nd Tenure Review is conducted for untenured Associate
Professor who received the outcome “Satisfactory” in the 1st Tenure
Review. This review must be completed before the end of Year 9 (The
TREC’s recommendation is sent to the President and the candidate is
notified of the Tenure Review outcome by the President). There are
two possible outcomes:
• “Successful”: Untenured Associate Professor is awarded tenure and
appointed as Professor with approval from the Board of Governors.
• “Unsuccessful”: The contract is terminated at the end of the
contract period.
Associate Professor (untenured at initial appointment)
The Tenure Review begins on or by the TESD, which is the last day of
the 6th month of Year 4 (3 years and 6 months after initial
appointment). The Tenure Review of an Associate Professor must be
completed by the end of Year 5. The TESD is the deadline for receiving
tenure materials from the candidate. The tenure review decision will
normally be made within 6 months of the TESD. The TESD cannot be
delayed, except for the circumstances in accordance with the “Stopthe-Clock” Policy in PRP3.2.5.2.2. An early review will be permitted
in exceptional circumstances.

16
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

Year 1: Appointment as Associate Professor (untenured at initial
appointment) begins. A Mentor is appointed.
End of Year 3:
The candidate, his/her mentor, and a tenured Faculty member
(appointed by the Dean of Faculty Affairs) meet to write a status
report about the candidate’s readiness for the tenure review. The
report will be submitted to the Dean of Faculty Affairs. The candidate
has a status meeting with the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
Between mid-Year 4 and Year 5: The Tenure Review is
conducted for Associate Professor (untenured at initial appointment).
By the end of Year 5, the Tenure Review must be completed (The
TREC’s recommendation is sent to the President and the candidate is
notified of the Tenure Review outcome by the President). There are
two possible outcomes:
• “Successful”: Untenured Associate Professor is awarded tenure and
appointed as Professor, with approval from the Board of Governors.
• “Unsuccessful”: The contract is terminated at the end of the
contract period, or one year from notification of the failed review,
whichever is later.
e) Process after Tenure Review
The TREC recommendation will be a file containing Tenure Review
papers and a cover letter from the Chair of the TREC, submitted to the
President, after review by the Appointment and Promotion Committee
as described in the TREC Handbook Version 3.0, through the Dean of
Faculty Affairs.
A positive recommendation from the TREC will proceed through the
following levels of review. In order, these are:
1) Review by the President
2) If the President agrees with the TREC recommendation, the file,
accompanied by a letter from the President, goes to the Board of
Governors for final approval.
3) If the President disagrees with the TREC recommendation, the
President will discuss how to resolve the disagreement with the
TREC. He/she may convene a separate assessment of the
candidate for own use if necessary
A negative TREC recommendation with which the President concurs,
will be sent to the candidate, and will also be reported to the Board of
Governors.
The unsuccessful candidate should work with the Dean of Research
and the Dean of Faculty Affairs to ensure an orderly transition,
including making proper provision for timely completion of any
theses in progress, for redeployment of continuing staff, and for
completion of contracts for fixed-term staff and post-doctoral
scholars.
17
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

3.2.5.2.2 “Stop-the-Clock” Policy for Tenure-track faculty
Tenure-track faculty may request a contract extension and
postponement of tenure review to accommodate parental
responsibilities relating to childbirth, adoption of a child, or rearing
of a baby. A second extension may be requested. Stop-the-Clock
cannot be multiplied for multiple births (e.g., twins).
This policy is independent of maternity, parental, or childcare leave.
Taking such leave does not automatically lead to application of Stopthe Clock Policy. An extension of the TESD does not alter the
candidate’s normal duties (i.e. teaching, supervision).
The form [Link] must be submitted to the Dean of Faculty Affairs
prior to the TESD. Upon approval of the form by the Dean of Faculty
Affairs and the President, the following actions will be taken.
1. The TESD will be postponed one year.
2. The employment of the candidate will be continued for one more
year.
3. The unit funding will be extended one year.
4. The contracts of unit staff will not automatically be extended.
In case of extenuating circumstances (e.g., multiple births, difficult
pregnancy, premature birth, or medical conditions associated with
childbirth), the Dean of Faculty Affairs may grant an additional 3-6month discretionary extension. A request for an additional extension
must be submitted to the Dean of Faculty Affairs together with
supporting documentation (e.g., a medical certificate).
OIST Tenure Review offers a flexible timeline. With approval from the
Dean of Faculty Affairs, “Stop-the-Clock” requests and other delays of
the TESD arising from exceptional circumstances may be
accommodated.
The total period of fixed-term contracts should not exceed 10 years for
either Assistant Professors or untenured Associate Professors, subject
to 3.2.5.2.4.
Under the Tenure Review (B), when an Assistant Professor received
the outcome “Satisfactory” in the 1st Tenure Review and undertakes a
2nd Tenure Review, that review must be concluded before the end of
Year 9. When the outcome of the 2nd Tenure Review is negative, the
contract of the candidate will be terminated at the end of the contract
period.
3.2.5.2.3 Appeal Process
The purpose of the appeal process is to determine whether the tenure
review procedures were correctly followed. The Appeal Process itself
is not a reevaluation of the decision. The grounds for an appeal are
limited to determining whether there were procedural errors (such as
18
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

the failure to bring proper facts and criteria to bear on a decision, or
the introduction of improper facts and criteria, or the failure to follow
procedures correctly) that substantially affected the outcome. An
unsuccessful candidate who believes there was a procedural error in
the tenure review can file an appeal with the Dean of Faculty Affairs
within ten (10) business days from receipt of the failure notice.
Detailed appeal documents, if any, should be submitted within one
month of registering the appeal.
When an appeal is filed, the matter is automatically referred to the
Dean of Research and the Dean of the Graduate School to select an
ad-hoc Appeal Committee comprised of tenured faculty. If the Appeal
Committee finds that there were procedural errors that substantially
affected the outcome, the Appeal Committee may recommend actions
to correct the errors. The details of the corrective actions will depend
on the nature of the procedural errors, but may involve a new TREC,
new external reviewers (letter writers), new letters, or other
changes. If the Appeal Committee finds that there were no
procedural errors that affected the outcome, the recommendation will
be to dismiss the appeal. The Appeal Committee, itself has no
authority to recommend or deny tenure.
The recommendation of the Appeal Committee is final and is
communicated in writing to the President and to the candidate who
filed the appeal within 2 months from registering the appeal. The
candidate may not challenge the outcome of the appeal. If further
actions are recommended by the Appeal Committee, it is the
responsibility of the President to implement those actions.
3.2.5.2.4 Total Period of Fixed-term Contracts
Under any circumstances, the total period of fixed-term contracts
should not exceed 10 years counting from the fixed term contract start
date executed on or after April 1, 2013 for either Assistant Professors
or untenured Associate Professors.
3.2.6 Annual Performance Evaluation, Bonuses, and Salary
Advancement
Faculty members will be evaluated for individual performance on an
annual basis. The evaluation will include performance in teaching,
research support activities, and university service.
Based on
satisfactory performance, faculty members are eligible for an annual
salary advancement based on OIST budget status and national
guidance for salary increases. Both annual one-time merit bonuses
and base salary advancement will be used to acknowledge exceptional
performance. Research performance of the faculty unit will be
evaluated separately.
3.2.7

Research Unit Budget and Evaluation
Each full-time and adjunct faculty research unit will receive multiyear subsidy support based on a proposal reviewed and approved at
19
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

the time of hiring for new faculty, or for current faculty, reviewed and
approved at a progress review conducted by a committee of experts
from outside of OIST [link: External Review Committee Handbook].
3.2.8

Conflict of Interest
OIST policies concerning conflicts of interest are described in PRP
Chapter 22. Members of the faculty must declare conflicts of interest
or the appearance of a conflict of interest when these exist. The
existence of a conflict of interest is not necessarily a barrier to
employment or procurement relationships. However, special
procedures must be followed to ensure the integrity of interactions
with and the fair treatment of students, researchers, employees,
contractors, vendors, and others associated with faculty in the
execution of their duties.

3.3 Retirement
The normal retirement date for faculty members will be at the end of the
academic year in which they reach 70 years of age, or on the date they reach
70, whichever is specified in the contract. Two years prior to retirement,
faculty members should work with the Dean of Research and the Dean of
Faculty Affairs to ensure an orderly transition- i.e., making proper provisions
for staff/postdocs, and other matters. Professors are not permitted to accept
new PhD students and to serve as their primary supervisors after reaching 65.
No external Unit review will be conducted after 65 years.
Faculty members may choose to retire early, after the age of 60, if they have
served the university in a significant capacity for at least 10 years. Early
retirement will be granted at the discretion of the President.
3.3.1

Emeritus Professor
OIST will apply the title Emeritus Professor indefinitely to all fulltime faculty upon retirement, including those who have retired early.
This comes with no salary, but with access to OIST resources and
limited privileges for a period of five years, which may be renewed in
negotiation with the President. Entitlement to emeritus status and
access to OIST resources is conditional upon adherence to Japanese
law and University policies, rules, and procedures. The President
may rescind both emeritus status and access without notice in the
event of a violation.

3.3.2

Continuing employment beyond retirement age
Upon invitation by the President, faculty members may extend their
contracts beyond retirement age, subject to successful external
review. Such cases will be highly unusual.

For continuing employment, faculty members will submit a research
plan with a term of no more than 5 years to the President for
agreement, including a strategy for closing the unit within the term,
and for being substantially financed using external funds. The
President and faculty members will discuss access to space and
20
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

equipment with the Dean of Research. If faculty members invited by
the President wish to continue doing research after retirement, they
must undergo an external review with their research plan in the
academic year in which they turn 68 in principle. Faculty members
thus approved after the external review will continue doing research
and carrying teaching and service responsibilities and the title
“Professor” during the agreed term beyond retirement age.
This is considered a fixed-term, untenured position and will involve a
significant reduction in unit space and funds. Salary will be
negotiable, but will normally be reduced.
3.3.3 Faculty members serving in executive capacities
Faculty members who have served in executive capacities (i.e. Dean
or Vice President) for a certain period will be allowed additional time
for research after the retirement date, that was negotiated with the
President. This policy will function as an incentive for faculty
members to assume executive functions. Research funds, salaries
and unit space will not be affected during this period, and will
continue as stipulated in their then current contract for the duration
of their additional service.
3.3.4

Non-Faculty Research Appointments
There are five classes of non-Faculty Research Appointments;
Postdoctoral Scholars [link: ], Staff Scientists [link: ], Research
Specialists [link: ], Technicians [link: ] and Science and Technology
Associates [link: ]. Non-faculty research staff may undertake limited
teaching duties as described in 3.2.2 item 6. The definition of each
non-Faculty Research Appointment is stipulated in 4.2.

3.4 Management Structure for Academic Issues
The management structure of the University is described in the Chapter 2. The
administrative organization responsible for faculty governance and academic
issues will be the Faculty Assembly (the “Assembly”). The Assembly will have
an executive body, the Faculty Council (the “Council”). The Assembly and
Council are described in sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, respectively. The
administrative home of the members of the faculty will be the Dean of Faculty
Affairs.
The Dean of Research will lead the Research Support Division; administer
common resources, shared equipment, grants and research computing;
promote good conduct in research and ensure that the research program
conforms to the highest ethical standards; lead appropriate subcommittees of
the Research Support Sections as well as represent OIST as needed in the
areas of safety and other research-related domains; liaise with the Deans for
Faculty Affairs and of the Graduate School.

21
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

The Dean of the Graduate School [link: ] will administer the OIST Graduate
School. The position of Dean of the Graduate School will be a rotating position
of the faculty with a three-year term, which is renewable at the discretion of
the President.
The Dean of the Graduate School will manage the academic program,
including the following matters:
• Student recruitment and admissions
• Curriculum and organization of courses
• Student guidance and supervision
• Student career development
• Award of degrees and graduation
• Enrollment, re-enrollment, withdrawals, transfers, overseas study, leave of
absence
• Appraisals and sanctions of students
• Evaluation of teaching
• Other matters relating to education
As necessary, the Dean of the Graduate School will appoint committees that
the Dean of the Graduate School chairs, the Dean of the Graduate School’s
committees, which include faculty members to advise on those matters
requiring academic and educational input. For instance, faculty will staff the
Admissions Committee. To enable changes to the curriculum in a given area,
the Dean of the Graduate School will choose specific people to help in
approving suggested modifications.
A Senior Assistant to the Dean of the Graduate School will administer the
student-related functions including financial aid to students, student housing,
student organization, student activities, student welfare, mentoring and career
development, and student records. The position of Senior Assistant is an
administrative, non-rotating position that will provide continuity in
administration of the Graduate School.

3.6 Strategies to Maintain and Improve the Quality of Teaching
Staff
3.6.1 Basic Policy of Educational Development
27
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

The University must maintain and improve the quality of its faculty
in order to provide an outstanding education at the University and to
meet the different educational needs of each student. The office of
the Dean of the Graduate School will play an active role in the
development of faculty members by implementing programs for
faculty development in teaching and supervision of graduate
students.
3.6.2 Methods
Specifically, the University will conduct the following:
3.6.2.1 Teaching Guidelines
The Dean of the Graduate School’s office will create, maintain
and distribute guidelines for quality teaching to ensure that
uniform best-practice teaching standards are observed at the
University.
3.6.2.2 Student Teaching Evaluations
Students will evaluate each course with a standardized
questionnaire at the end of the course. The student responses
will be reported to the Dean of the Graduate School’s office and
will be distributed to the instructors and students. The Dean of
the Graduate School’s office will assist the instructors to respond
appropriately to this feedback. This feedback should be treated
as confidentially as possible.
3.6.2.3 Peer Review of Teaching
Faculty members will support the development of their
colleagues by participating from time to time as classroom
observers, with the agreement of the instructor. The date of such
observation will be reported to the Dean of the Graduate
School’s office, and the observer will discuss their observations
with the instructor in a collegial, respectful and supportive
manner.
3.6.2.4 Instructor Training
The Dean of the Graduate School’s office will arrange training
sessions, and workshops for faculty development from suitably
qualified facilitators, in order to enhance the teaching ability of
faculty members.
3.6.2.5 Mentoring
A mentoring system will be established so that faculty with less
experience in teaching and thesis supervision can meet with
more experienced faculty to receive advice and support. As a part
of this system the Thesis Committee supervising each student
will include junior and senior faculty members to facilitate the
transfer of skills relating to supervision of research.

28
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

The Dean of the Graduate School’s office will implement these
methods to ensure the improvement of the education and research of
the Graduate University.
3.7 Faculty Leave
3.7.1 Holiday Entitlements
Holiday entitlements are defined in PRP Chapter 33 Leave.
3.7.2 Sabbatical Leave
Sabbatical leave offers tenured faculty members opportunities for
study, research, acquisition of new techniques, and enhanced
professional development. Sabbatical leave allows faculty members
to focus on such matters without teaching and administrative duties.
Details are described in the Sabbatical Leave Application Handbook.
Tenured faculty members are eligible to apply for sabbatical leave if
they have served at least six (6) years since joining OIST as full-time
faculty members. The tenure-track period is included as part of the
sabbatical qualifying period so that untenured faculty members can
apply for sabbatical leaves after being awarded tenure. Years from
the OIST Promotion Corporation period are not counted.
For every three (3) years of academic service, tenured faculty
members earn six (6) months of sabbatical credit. The maximum
sabbatical credit that can be accrued is twelve (12) months.
Once eligibility is granted, at least nine (9) months before the start of
the academic year in which sabbatical leave is to commence, the
applicant must submit a “Request for Sabbatical Leave Application
Form” online.
As part of sabbatical leave application process, an agreement
between the host institution and OIST must be prepared. This
agreement must include management of intellectual property that
may result from the sabbatical research, and other pertinent
sabbatical terms and conditions.
After submitting the online application form, the applicant must
make necessary arrangements with the Deans of the Graduate School
(DGS) and Faculty Affairs (DFA) to cover teaching, supervision of
students and unit members, and administrative responsibilities
during sabbatical leave.
When arrangements described in Sections 5 and 6in the Handbook
have been approved in principle by the three Deans (DFA, DGS, and
DoR) and if the Executive Vice President for Technology Development
and Innovation and General Counsel validate the Intellectual
Property-related arrangements with the host institution, the three
Deans will sign the Sabbatical Leave Application Form. The
application form will be sent by the Faculty Affairs Office to the
President for final approval.
3.7.3 Leave without Salary
A leave without salary is a period of leave that is without salary from

Term of Appointment and Term of Research Support as
described in 3.7.3.3, and 3.7.3.4, but on a proportional basis.
3.7.4 Period of Pure Research Leave
Full-time faculty members may apply for a period of pure research
leave, which is defined as leave from teaching and other institutional
responsibilities during which the faculty member receives full or
partial salary supported by the University.
3.7.4.1 Requesting a Period of Pure Research Leave
Applications for periods of pure research should be requested on
the regular leave form for review and approval by the Dean of
the Graduate School and the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
3.7.4.2 Reviewing a Request for Period of Pure Research Leave

Chapter 39 Resolving Complaints & Disputes. For complaints and
disputes reported by faculty, the supervisor is the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
The next level of management for the Dean of Faculty Affairs is the
CEO/President. For Committee Level Dispute Resolution, the
CEO/President will appoint a Dispute Resolution Committee. For
complaints and disputes reported by employees supervised by faculty, the
standard procedures described in Chapter 39 apply. For complaints and
disputes reported by students, the procedures in Chapter 5 Graduate
School Handbook apply.
3.10 Term and Conditions of Appointment
3.10.1 Employment Agreement
The term and conditions of academic appointments are stated in the
Employment Agreement, a copy of which should be in the possession
of both the University and the faculty member. The term of academic
appointments may be either (a) for a fixed number of years for nontenured appointments or (b) without limit of time for tenured
appointments. A tenured academic appointment without limit of
time extends from the effective date of the appointment to the date
of academic retirement of the appointee.
3.10.2 Prior Notice of Non-renewal of Appointment
A faculty member holding a renewable, non-tenured appointment
shall be notified by one year before the end of the term of the
31
ch03_faculty-handbook_en_20180608_cl

appointment if the appointment is not to be renewed. Failure to give

notification.
3.10.3 Prior Notice of Non-renewal of Internal Funding
A tenured or non-tenured faculty member who after review has been
notified that his or her internal funding will not be renewed will be
provided with a negotiated level of funding to allow a scale-down
during the last year of funding. Failure to give timely notice of nonrenewal of internal funding shall entitle the individual to an
extension of the current level of internal funding to the date of
notification and to an extension of the scale-down period to a period
of one year from the time of notification.
3.11 Discipline
Procedures for taking disciplinary action in response to conduct that

OIST Graduate University Policies, Rules & Procedures
Authority: Approved by the Dean of Research and the President

Chapter 4. Research Activities
4.1
Policy
The OIST Graduate University (hereinafter, “University”) promotes research activities that
embody the five central concepts stated in 1.1.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE OIST GRADUATE
UNIVERSITY: Best in the World, International, Flexible, Global Networking, and
Collaboration with Industry. The University encourages interdisciplinary research through
effective collaboration between University faculty, research staff (which means those who
engage in research activities at the University (people with research appointment other than
University Faculty, Research Fellows and Science and Technology Associates; the same
applies hereinafter), and students. The University respects Academic Freedom, and all
researchers (University faculty and research staff; the same applies hereinafter) at the
University should observe Openness in Research. The Office of the Dean of Research [link:
2.4.5.7] is responsible for providing technical and administrative support for the Research
Units.
A unique feature of research at the University is its internal funding that enables challenging
critical problems with cutting-edge technologies. The President, through the Dean of
Research, has the authority to allocate internal research funding for common resources and
Research Units in accordance with their research programs. The Dean of Research is
responsible for implementing the mechanisms to ensure the efficient and fair use of research
resources. Over the years, the University is expected to become less dependent on
government subsidies and expects to be able to win competitive research grants and funding
from industry. All faculty and research staff are encouraged to apply for external funding,
and the Dean of Research shall provide support for externally funded research applications
and monitor execution of these grants.
All researchers are expected to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and uphold
the highest standards of research ethics and integrity. It is the responsibility of all
researchers at OIST to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken with regard to the
recording, handling and preservation of data and associated information such as computer
programs and logbooks, and take great care to prevent any research activity misconduct,
such as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, in the research groups. Faculty have a
responsibility to promote and oversee the proper conduct of research in their Unit.
While externally funded research and collaboration with industry is encouraged, secret
research that precludes the disclosure of research results is not permitted. Sponsored
research for which the sponsor requires a delay in publication in excess of six months may
constitute “secret” research. The research conducted at the University must be intended for
public dissemination.

1

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

Research at the University may not be conducted for the economic benefit of any particular
company or other commercial entity. Commercially sponsored research has the potential to
generate significant Conflicts of Interest [link: 22], which must be disclosed and carefully
evaluated.
In case conducting collaborative research with academia, such research shall be conducted
in accordance with OIST Graduate University Joint Research Regulations. [link: ]
It is prohibited by law to use the subsidy for operations of the University for purposes other
than University’s business.

term period until the age of 65, unless either party raises the issue of termination of the
employment contract at least one month before the end of contract term period.
Continuing appointment or promotion to a higher level is based on documented scientific
achievements during their term at the University or on research and professional work
performed at other institutions before coming to the University. Performance is measured
against scientific productivity, interaction with other scientists, other achievements, and
scientifically and technically up-to-date evidence outlined by the employee and confirmed
in letters of reference. Measures of performance include publications, collaborations,
awards, presented lectures, and participation in professional organizations. Staff Scientists
with Continuing appointments will be reviewed by the Continuing Staff Appointment
Committee no less than every five years for promotion and salary adjustments.
4.2.5 Postdoctoral Scholars
Definitions for Postdoctral Scholars are described in “Guidelines for Title and Job Class”.
Initial appointments may be up to three years, with extensions to a fourth year being
possible and to a fifth year only under extreme circumstances. The appointment is “Fixedterm” without renewal, which means that it is a temporary appointment normally for 3
years and cannot exceed 5 years.
4.2.6 Research Unit Technicians
Definitions for Research Unit Technicians are described in “Guidelines for Title and Job
Class”. Research Unit Technicians appointments are generally Fixed-term, but may be
continued by re-appointment as a “Fixed-term” or converted to a Continuing appointment.
Continuing appointments must be approved by the Continuing Staff Appointment
Committee.
4.2.7 Dean’s Research Group
The Dean’s Research Group carries out research under the guidance of the Dean of
Faculty Affairs, and is used in exceptional circumstances when, for example, there are
research staff whose supervisor is no longer capable of supervising them (e.g. is on
extended leave) and where there is no alternative unit or support service which can
accommodate them.
Appointment is by the Dean of Faculty Affairs, and requires the support of the
Dean of Research and the approval of the President.

6

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

of the ORC.
4.5.3
Meetings
The ORC will hold meetings as necessary and at least quarterly. Each unit is encouraged
to have at least one member attend the meetings to encourage interaction,
communication, and collaboration at OIST. Decisions of the ORC will be made by
majority vote with each attending member having a single vote. At the discretion of the
Chairperson, Executives or Faculty Members may be invited to attend for specific items
on the agenda and may be invited to stay for the rest of the meeting.
4.5.4
Chairperson and Secretary
The Chairperson leads the ORC and moderates the discussion in the ORC meetings. The
Chairperson and a Secretary schedule the meetings for the ORC. The Secretary prepares
the agenda and records notes of the proceedings. In the absence of the Chairperson or
Secretary, the Researcher Representatives assume these roles.
4.5.5
Researcher Representatives and Researcher Representative
Alternate
The Researcher Representatives and Researcher Representative Alternate bring feedback
to, or initiate discussion with, the Faculty Assembly and members of the Executive as
appropriate. They may submit topics for consideration to the Chair of the Faculty
Assembly, based on discussions of the ORC.
4.5.6
Advisory Groups and Assistants
The Chairperson may organize ad hoc or standing Advisory Groups to assist the
Researcher Representatives for specific tasks or issues of importance to the ORC. The
Chairperson may appoint Assistants as necessary to manage the administration of the
ORC.
4.6
The Science and Technology Group (STG)
To achieve its goals, the University needs to be able to respond flexibly to opportunities to
extend and complement its research portfolio and to pursue activities in support of the wider
development of Okinawa. The STG provides a focus for these activities and contributes to the
research capabilities of the University in many ways. It enables new scientific or technical
directions to be supported where a full research unit is not warranted, as well as providing
skilled leadership for technical support services, or develops scientific, technical, industrial,
educational or cultural collaborations with local and international institutions.
4.6.1
Science and Technology Associates (STA)
STA work in the STG on projects that extend and complement the University’s research
portfolio and that support the wider development of Okinawa. These positions cover a
wide range of skills and are used flexibly to enhance the capabilities of the University.
STAs require special research skills and subject knowledge in a relevant scientific,
technical, industrial, educational, or cultural discipline. There are three STA levels,
dependent upon qualifications and experience, with each level requiring increasing
professional achievement. Definitions for STAs are described in “Guidelines for Title and
7

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

Job Class”.
STAs may conduct their own research or may be affiliated with a research unit and
allocated resources. With the agreement of the Dean of Faculty Affairs, STAs may apply
for external grants as a Principal Investigators.
Where there is an affiliation with a research unit, the STA’s research evaluation will
normally be included in the unit review or tenure review of the Principal Investigator who
leads the unit based on on-site review by external reviewers. For such STAs, the external
expert peer reviews are not conducted independently and the 1st and the 2nd external
expert peer reviews stipulated in 4.6.1.1 are replaced with such unit review or tenure
review, followed by the recommendations stipulated in 4.6.1.3 and 4.6.1.4; provided,
however, such recommendations will include the STA’s contract and/or promotion (if
applicable), but not research funding as the STA’s budget is included in the unit budget.
4.6.1.1 Criteria for External Expert Peer Review
Appointment and research evaluation of STAs is based on external expert peer
reviews. Ideally the first review will be conducted before the end of Year 4, and
the second review before the end of Year 8 if another non-continuing
appointment is offered by the first review. Details of peer review procedures are
defined by the Dean of Faculty Affairs [Link: Review Handbook for
Science and Technology Associates]. Review criteria include following:
1. Quality and significance of the research or research-equivalent activity.
2. Scientific, technical, industrial, educational or cultural importance and interest
of the work.
3. Demonstrated effective utilization of research resources.
4. Contribution to development of external partnerships with academic
institutions, industries, or other international and local institutions.
5. Proposed future work.
4.6.1.2 “Stop-the-Clock” policy for STAs
STAs may request contract extensions and postponement of reviews to
accommodate parental responsibilities relating to childbirth, adoption of a child,
or rearing of a baby. A second extension may be requested. Stop-the-Clock
cannot be multiplied for multiple births (e.g., twins).
This policy is independent of maternity, parental, or childcare leave. Taking such
leave does not automatically lead to application of Stop-the-Clock Policy. An
extension of the review start date does not alter the STA’s normal duties.
The Stop-the-Clock application form must be submitted to the Dean of Faculty
Affairs before the review process begins (i.e., by the due date for submission of
materials for review evaluation). Upon approval of the application form by the
Dean of Faculty Affairs and the President, the following actions will be taken.

8

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

1.

The review date will be postponed by up to one year.

2. Employment of the candidate will be continued for one more year,
subject to 4.6.1 5).
3.

Research funding will be extended by up to one year.

In case of extenuating circumstances (e.g., multiple births, difficult pregnancy,
premature birth, or medical conditions associated with childbirth), the Dean of
Faculty Affairs may grant an additional 3-6- month discretionary extension. A
request for an additional extension must be submitted to the Dean of Faculty
Affairs together with supporting documentation (e.g., a medical certificate).
4.6.1.3 Process after the 1st review
a) Initial appointment of an STA is usually a non-continuing appointment up to
five years. Based on the result of the 1st external expert peer review described in
4.6.1.1 and anticipated future contributions to the University, the Dean of Faculty
Affairs, the Dean of Research, and the Chair of the Faculty Assembly or his/her
nominee will make recommendations to the President about the STA’s contract
and research funding. The recommendations include:
1. Offer of another contract as a non-continuing appointment, research
funding up to five years, and/or promotion (if applicable); or
2. Termination of appointment of a non-continuing STA at the end of
their current contract period, or one year from notification of the
decision, whichever is later, subject to the limitation in 4.6.1.5.
b) In special circumstances, prior to that the above recommendations in 4.6.1.3
(a) are made, the Dean of Faculty Affairs can decide to propose a continuing
appointment to the Continuing Staff Appointment Committee (CSAC) by
considering the outcome of the 1st external expert peer review described in 4.6.1.1
and anticipated future contributions to the University. Procedures with the CSAC
are described in 4.6.1.4 (b).
The President will render a decision based on the recommendations above and
will inform the STA of the result.
4.6.1.4 Process after the 2nd review (Change to continuing
appointment)
The Dean of Faculty Affairs will decide whether to propose a change from noncontinuing to continuing appointment to the CSAC by considering the outcome
of the 2nd external expert peer review described in 4.6.1.1 and anticipated future
contributions to the University.
a) If the Dean of Faculty Affairs decides not to propose a continuing
9

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

appointment, the Dean of Faculty Affairs recommends that the President
terminate non-continuing appointment of the STA at the end of their current
contract period, or one year from notification of the decision, whichever is later,
subject to the limitation in 4.6.1.5. If the President disagrees with termination of
the appointment, he may discuss other outcomes with the STA.
b) If the Dean of Faculty Affairs proposes a continuing-appointment,
documentation will be submitted to the CSAC. This includes the complete dossier
for the external expert peer review, plus a letter from the Dean of Faculty Affairs
making the case that the conditions are satisfied. The CSAC will use the following
criteria to recommend a continuing-appointment, research funding, and/or
promotion (if applicable) to the President:
1. That the record of achievements during the period under review was
“Outstanding” or “Excellent”;
2. That proposed future work is judged to be of high quality, with a good
chance of having a significant impact in that discipline over the next
10-15 years;
3. That there is an identifiable benefit to OIST’s academic reputation.
The CSAC is comprised of the Executive Vice President for Technology
Development and Innovation, the Dean of Research, the Dean of Faculty Affairs,
and the Chair of the Faculty Assembly or his/her nominee. Since the Dean of
Faculty Affairs is a member of the CSAC and is the proponent for the continuing
appointment of the STA, the Dean of Faculty Affairs will present the
recommendation, but will not participate in discussions regarding the STA’s
continuing appointment during the CSAC meeting.
When the CSAC recommends the continuing appointment and the President
approves the recommendation, the STA can convert from a non-continuing to a
continuing appointment. Continuing STA appointments are based on the
University’s employment contract, which can be renewed under the same terms
and conditions for the same term period until age 65, unless either party raises
the issue of termination of the employment contract in accordance with the
applicable Rules of Employment.
If the CSAC does not recommend a continuing appointment, the STA’s
appointment will terminate at the end of their current contract period, or one
year from notification of the decision, whichever is later, subject to the limitation
in 4.6.1.5.
4.6.1.5 Total period of non-continuing appointment
Under no circumstances, should the total period of non-continuing appointment
10

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

exceed 10 years counting from the fixed term (non-continuing) contract start
date or a contract extension executed on or after April 1, 2013.
4.6.1.6 STAs with continuing appointments
STAs with continuing appointments will be evaluated by external peer review and
will be reviewed for research funding, promotion, and salary adjustments (if
applicable) by the CSAC at least every five years. If the CSAC recommends
promotion, the Dean of Faculty Affairs will forward the CSAC’s recommendation
to the President for a final decision.
Continuing STAs will still be able to raise external funding in addition to research
funding provided by the University or to replace OIST funding if the University’s
research funding is discontinued after a negative external review. Should the
STA’s achievements warrant, with approval of the Dean of Faculty Affairs, the
STA may apply for timely external peer review in order to restart OIST subsidy
funding after it has been discontinued. Based on the outcome of the external peer
review, the President will
1. Approve restarting research funding for up to five years, or
2. Disapprove restarting research funding.
4.6.2

The Science and Technology Group (STG) Forum
4.6.2.1 The Role of the STG Forum
The STG Forum provides an opportunity for the members of the STG to discuss
the development of the STG, and it provides them with information about
university matters, collects their opinions and suggestions to provide feedback to
the University, identifies and discusses common issues, and allows them to share
research results.
4.6.2.2 Membership and Officers
All STAs are members of the STG Forum. One member will be elected as the
Chair of the Forum. The STG Forum will also elect the STG Representative to the
Faculty Assembly.
4.6.2.3 Meetings
The Forum will meet at least twice in each academic year. Forum meetings are
attended by the Dean of Faculty Affairs, the Dean of Research, the STG Research
Unit Administrator (who acts as the forum secretary), the Executive Assistant to
the Dean of Faculty Affairs, and the HR Assistant to the Dean of Faculty Affairs
as necessary. The President has a standing invitations to attend.
The Dean of Faculty Affairs reports on the STG Forum to the Faculty Council,
and presents the STG Annual Report to the Faculty Assembly.

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

In enhancing OIST research through collaboration and ezchange, OIST invites researchers
from other Universities or research entities to conduct research with OIST researchers. This
collaboration arrangement is normally requested by faculty, and approved by the Dean of
Research. The collaboration regularly entails access to OIST facilities and resources, which
must be appropriately requested and authorized as part of the approval process. The
categories are as defined below, with application and approval procedures managed through
the resource center, with additional approvals made by relevant resource managers. Please
see the resource center webpage for details of the application and approval process for
external researchers.
4.7.1 Visiting Researchers

4.8
Mentor
The University provides mentors who give appropriate assistance and advice to junior
researchers so that they can perform research activities responsibly and autonomously.
Researchers (including Research Fellows) who belong to a research unit and members of the
STG are basically mentored by faculty members who are responsible for the research unit
and the Dean of the Faculty Affairs, respectively. Junior faculty members are mentored by
senior faculty members, and the assignments appointments are made by the Dean for the
Faculty Affairs. Students are mentored by academic mentors [link: 5.3.10].
4.9
Responsibilities for Research Staff and Student
Faculty members are not only scientific mentors for research staff and students but are also
leaders in the workplace. They should make sure that the Policy on a Respectful Workplace is
observed within their units. Each faculty member should provide an opportunity for their
unit members to clearly understand this Policy. Assessing the knowledge of these policies
and inviting constructive input regarding these policies should be part of each unit members’
annual performance appraisal.

4.11 Research Ethics, Compliance, and Prevention of Conflicts of Interest
Recognizing that scientific research is developed on a foundation of a public trust mandate,
researchers must make honest and sincere decisions, and act accordingly to ensure
responsible conduct of research. The University promotes responsible conduct of research
and has established mechanisms to respond appropriately to research misconduct in line
with the Code of Conduct for Scientists (2013, Science Council of Japan) and the Guidelines
for Providing an Appropriate Response to Misconduct in Research Activities (2014, Decision
by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology).
Experiments in certain categories are required to be reviewed by the relevant Advisory
Committee and then approved by the Dean of Research before commencement. Further,
some materials and equipment are subject to regulatory controls (including administrative
guidelines) for acquisition, handling, storage, record-keeping, disposal, and installation.
Activities involving controlled items must comply with relevant statutes, regulations and
guidelines. Researchers have the right to engage in consulting and other activities with
external partners, subject to the University’s policy on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment
as defined in Chapter 22.
4.11.1 Mechanisms for the Responsible Conduct of Research
4.11.1.1 Research Ethics Chief Administrative Officer
The President has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring responsible research

14

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

conduct at the University as the Research Ethics Chief Administrative Officer.
The Research Ethics Chief Administrative Officer eliminates those factors that
may foster wrongful research conduct, and establishes an environment and
processes that ensure and encourage responsible conduct of research by
implementing adequate misconduct-prevention functions. Further, if any
misconduct occurs, the Research Ethics Chief Administrative Officer provides
the necessary measures impartially and appropriately.
4.11.1.2 Research Ethics Education Officer
The Dean of Research administers the promotion of the research ethics
education provided at the University as the Research Ethics Education Officer.
4.11.2 Research Ethics Education
All researchers, staff, and students of the University including faculty, postdoctoral
scholars, staff scientists, research specialists, technicians, Research Fellows and science
and technology associates must receive research ethics education [link: TBP] at least
once every 5 years. When non-OIST researchers or students temporarily engage in
research activities at the University for collaborative research, internship programs, or
other reasons, the research units or sections that accept these non-OIST personnel are
required to ensure that they receive the research ethics education. The Occupational
Health and Safety Section supports the Dean of Research in the preparation of the
research ethics education materials and the management of attendance records.
4.11.3 Management of Research Data and Laboratory Notebooks
Research data are valuable not only for the researcher who obtained them but also for the
science community at large. All researchers are asked to preserve data in a secure,
identifiable way with appropriate backup methods, and disclose these when necessary. Any
research results at the University, including laboratory notebooks and electronic data files,
are in general deemed as property of the University. It is the responsibility of each
researcher to ensure that all of their research is properly documented in accordance with
best practice in the field of study. This responsibility includes the safe keeping of research
data and where appropriate lab note books, for future examination. Faculty should provide
clear guidance to all researchers in their Unit on the form that this research record should
take. The fabrication or falsification of data, and the plagiarism are not tolerated. The
dissemination of research data on public databases is encouraged, while the best care must
be taken to protect the privacy of human subjects data. When research staff leaves a
research unit, an agreement should be made with the faculty regarding what data can be
moved. When a faculty member or research staff leaves the University, while the ownership
of the research data remains with the University, the Dean of Research can authorize a
proper data transfer arrangement to ensure that the on-going research is not hindered.
4.11.4 Management of Research Materials
Research materials used in research, such as genetic samples and living modified
organisms (LMOs), are valuable resources for the science community at large. Many
journals and funding agencies require such materials to be made publicly available
15

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

after publication. Appropriate conditions, such as extremely low temperatures, must
be maintained for the preservation of research samples/materials and one must take
proper procedures when transferring them so that she/he can respond to such request
by other researchers. Research samples and materials must be preserved for at least
five years from the date they were generated, published, or presented at a conference.
When providing or accepting research materials, a material transfer agreement (MTA)
is required between the parties. When a researcher moves to another institution, an
agreement is required beforehand concerning the division of materials.
4.11.5 Research Protocols
Faculty members need to ensure that research protocols in certain categories (such as
the research involving radioisotopes, recombinant DNA, pathogens, toxins, animal or
human subjects) are approved by the relevant Advisory Committee before
commencement of the research and that approved protocols are followed by all
research unit members. For specific research protocols that require approval, see
Chapter 13 “Safety, Health & Environmental Protection”.
4.11.6 Publication of Research Results
The results of research conducted at the University are required to be made public as
soon as possible in the form of journal articles, presentation at a conference or
similarly appropriate venues (PRP 1.3.1, Openness in Research). While publishing
research results, faculty members and researchers must ensure that there are no
violations, such as fabrications, falsifications, plagiarism, duplicate submissions,
inappropriate authorship, or the use of copyrighted materials without gaining
permission or giving credit.
The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University Institutional
Repository (hereinafter referred to as “OISTIR”) serves as the platform for public
access to the intellectual output of the University. Publications and other research
results should be deposited in the OISTIR, except in rare circumstances approved by
the Library Director. Those who deposit materials in the OISTIR should follow the
Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University Institutional
Repository Operational Guidelines to maintain an open-access environment.
Publications in open access journals are encouraged and may receive support from the
central budget.
4.11.7 Export and Import Compliance
Japan, like most nations, imposes controls and duties on the import and export of
many goods, including materials and equipment used in basic research of the type
conducted at the University. Intellectual property such as software, production knowhow, and even User Manuals are also regulated and controlled by the import/export
regulations. Goods approved for import may also be subject to fees/taxes (sometimes
referred to as “duties”) and periodical report to the authority, although items used in
university-based research may be eligible for an exemption from duties. Great care
must be exercised and the Security Export Control Officer should be consulted to

16

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

assure export/import control compliance. Refer to the government’s Security Trade
Control website [link: http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/anpo/englishpage.html] and the
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law [link:
http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=21&vm=04&re=01]
4.11.8 Conflicts of Interest and Commitment
Faculty members must disclose any situation that could lead to any real or apparent
conflicts of interest as detailed in Chapter 22 “Avoiding Conflicts of Interest and
Commitment”.
4.12 Health, Safety, and Environmental Protection
All researchers conducting research activities must do so under the relevant health, safety,
and environmental protection regulations. For health, safety and environmental protection
information, researchers are required to fully understand and observe Chapter 13 “Safety,
Health & Environmental Protection”.
Each faculty member is responsible for training the members of their team in the
appropriate health and safety procedures for that particular research area and for the
management of those procedures in their laboratory or other workplace. Faculty members
are also responsible for the safety of the laboratory facilities and equipment and are
required to cooperate with investigations and inspections by University personnel or
external agencies.
4.13 Intellectual Property
Intellectual property may be a source of revenue to support the education and research
mission of the University [link: 14]. In recognition of this, the University requires disclosure
to the University when information and developments derived from research may be of
broader benefit or/and have commercial value. The Technology Licensing Section provides
support in identifying and evaluating potential intellectual property, manages the
preparation of patent applications, and monitors the effective use of such properties.
Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agreements raise significant concerns as the terms of
such agreements may conflict with the University’s Openness in Research Policy. A
contractual commitment to keep information secret can severely restrict the ability of
University faculty to pursue research in the manner they choose and can make it difficult for
the University to protect the ideas and inventions derived from the work of the faculty and
researchers.
It is forbidden to sign or otherwise bind the University to a confidentiality obligation
without first having obtained written approval from the General Counsel. Those seeking an
in-depth review of this subject relating to the University’s activities, please see Chapter 14,
“Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer”.
4.14 Fiscal Obligations
Faculty members and recipients of external grants are responsible for managing their
funding properly and efficiently. (See Chapter 26 “Finance and Accounting”)

4.15 Operation and Management of Public Research Grants
4.15.1 Mechanisms for the Operation and Management of Public Research
Grants
4.15.1.1 Public Research Grant Chief Administrative Officer
The President has the ultimate responsibility for the operation and management
of public research grants at the University as the Public Research Grants Chief
Administrative Officer. The Public Research Grants Chief Administrative Officer
is required to ensure that all factors that may foster misconduct relating to the
operation and management of public research grants are eliminated through the
establishment of mechanisms that have adequate misconduct-prevention
functions. Further, if any misconduct occurs, the Public Research Grants Chief
Administrative Officer is required to provide all necessary measures impartially
and appropriately.
4.15.1.2 Public Research Grants General Administrative Officer
The Dean of Research assists the Public Research Grants Chief Administrative
Officer, and has the authority and responsibility for the operation and
management of public research grants as a Public Research Grants General
Administrative Officer at the University. The Public Research Grants General
Administrative Officer develops Misconduct Prevention Plan and provides
education and training workshops based on the Misconduct Prevention Plan to
staff members in a planned and consistent manner.
4.15.1.3 Public Research Grants Compliance Officer
The Research Finance Manager appointed in the Office of the Dean of Research,
the Grants and Research Collaborations Section Leader and the Business
Development Section Leader play the following roles as a Public Research Grants
Compliance Officers:
(1) Applies misconduct prevention measures, confirms the status of the
implementation, and submits periodical reports to the Public Research
Grants General Administrative Officer
(2) Prevent misconduct, provides compliance education programs to all
persons engaged in work relating to the use or management of public
research grants, and provides supervision over the attendance and
accomplishments
(3) Monitors the use and management of public research grants by the
persons engaged in such works relating to the use or management of
public research grants and provides instructions for improvements
as necessary
4.15.2 Internal Research Funding
The University’s internal funding for a research unit is allocated each fiscal year based on
a five-year research program confirmed by the President at the time of the initial
18

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

appointment and recommended by a review committee at the time of renewal. Any
research equipment approved for a five-year research program should be considered
common or shared equipment. The Dean of Research along with the Research Support
Sections investigate purchases of any research equipment over five million yen for
possible use as common or shared equipment.
4.15.2.1 Common Research Resources
The Research Support Sections overseen by the Dean of Research manages the
common research facilities and equipment and provides services to the research
units. The Resources Allocation Committee [link: TBP] considers the
introduction of new equipment and services as well as improvements in their
operations and forwards such recommendations to the Dean of Research.
4.15.2.2 Internal Cost Charging
The Research Support Sections may charge research units for the use of common
research equipment and services to promote fair and efficient use.
4.15.3 External Research Funding
While internal research funding is a highly attractive feature for faculty, the University as
a whole is expected to gradually depend less on government subsidies and more on
competitive government grants and private funding. It is also important for the financial
freedom of the University to provide flexible support for its research, education, and
community building. The Grants and Research Collaborations Section overseen by the
Dean of Research provides support for researchers to submit competitive research grant
proposals and to spend the budget effectively in compliance with the funding agency
regulations. When submitting grant proposals, requirements for additional space,
equipment maintenance costs and the required incremental administrative support
should be adequately considered.
4.15.3.1 Public Grant Application
Applications for government, prefectural, or international research grants by all
eligible researchers are encouraged. Non-faculty researchers should consult the
faculty before application, so that the pursuit of the grant does not interfere with
the overall goal of the research unit. Any submission that requires additional
laboratory or office space, and does not cover indirect costs or requires matching
internal funding, requires additional scrutiny. All grant applications must be
approved by the Dean of Research before submission.
4.15.3.2 Private Funding and Joint Research
When an opportunity for private research funding or joint research with an
industrial partner emerges, the faculty is required to consult the Business
Development Section for the appropriate contract or agreement. Privately funded
research at the University must be of an academic nature and needs to be
disseminated as a publication or conference presentation (see PRP 1.3.1
Openness in Research). When conducting privately funded or joint industrial
19

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

research, the policies and requirements regarding Intellectual Property and
Technology Transfer and Avoiding Conflicts of Interest and Commitment must
be observed.
4.15.3.3 Management of External Funds
The use of external grants in general needs to conform to the requirements
described in the University Policies, Rules & Procedures, in the same manner as
internal research funding. Any additional requirements by the funding agency
have to be observed. All grant recipients should be aware that non-compliance
with the rules, both intentionally or mistakenly, can negatively impact the
reputation of the University and can result in extensive sanctions for the
offending faculty member.
4.16 External Use of Research Facilities and Services
The University is privileged to have cutting-edge research facilities and equipment along with
expert technical support staff. While the University’s research facilities and services are
primarily for its own research and education, the utilization of excess capacity by external
academic or industrial users can contribute to the advancement of science and technology in
Okinawa and can foster active research communities around the University. The Office of the
Dean of Research, overseen by the Dean of Research, promotes the external use of the
University’s research facilities and services while assuring availability for internal users, the
proper charging of both direct and indirect costs, safety, security, and compliance with the
University’s policies and applicable regulations.
4.16.1 Condition of Use
An external user of the University’s facilities and services must sign an agreement that
outlines the safety and security, the ethical standards of the University, and the
responsibilities of the user. If the user’s research has not been reviewed by an
institutional review board, approval by the University’s applicable committees, such as
the Human Subjects Research Review Committee, is required. Users are also required
to have adequate training by the staff of the Dean of Research’s Division before using
any equipment. Any damage caused to the University’s facilities, equipment, or other
resources by a user must be compensated for by the user.
4.16.2 Scheduling and Prioritization
The Office of the Dean of Research is required to implement appropriate procedures for
the scheduling of the facility use so that the University researchers’ programs are not
compromised.
4.16.3 Cost Charging
The Office of the Dean of Research, under the oversight of the Dean of Research, is
required to establish appropriate charges for facility use and services for internal users,
external academic users, and industrial users. The basic principle is to charge internal
users for the incremental cost per use and to charge external academic users for a share
of the annual maintenance costs and to charge industrial users for the installation and
20

ch04_research-activities_en_20181025_cl

depreciation of the facility.
4.17 Reporting and Investigation procedures
For reporting and investigation procedures in the case of any misconduct or suspicion
thereof in research activities and use of research grants, see Chapter 23.

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules & Procedures
Authority:
⚫ Approved by the President
⚫ School Education Act

Chapter 5. Graduate School Handbook
5.1.The Graduate School
The mission of the Graduate School of the OIST Graduate University is to provide first-class
postgraduate education to the highest international standard. The Graduate School
implements the following three core policies:
i.

Admission Policy:

The Graduate University aims to train researchers who will play important roles in the
international scientific community at leading scientific institutions in the public and
private sectors. Accordingly, the Admissions Policy will make it a principle to recruit
candidates with the potential and motivation to become leaders in scientific research on
the international stage.
Recruitment will focus on attracting outstanding students from within Japan and
internationally. Here “outstanding students” means students who are highly motivated by
the excitement and potential of the cutting-edge research that is possible at OIST, who
have the curiosity and academic ability needed to excel in their chosen areas of study, and
who have the capacity for independent research and original thinking. Our students will
also require proficiency in oral and written communication skills in English for advanced
study in science, and the ability to interact effectively with people from a wide range of
backgrounds.
Students will be eligible to apply if they are expected to complete a BSc or equivalent
degree prior to admission, or have previously completed a BSc, MSc or equivalent degree
representing the completion of an undergraduate course in science and engineering, or
exceptionally in other fields. The student should meet requirements for admission to a
graduate school under the School Education Act. Those who hold a Masters degree may be
exempted from some coursework with the approval of the Dean. Successful candidates will
only be enrolled into a doctoral program.

ii. Curriculum Policy:
In keeping with the concept of “best in the world” we will recruit outstanding students and
conduct top class academic instruction. The academic program will aim to develop the full
potential of each student toward scientific excellence and independence. In accordance
with this aim, every student will be treated as a unique individual and have their program

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

of studies tailored to their scientific aspirations, prior education, and current interests. The
basic principles of the curriculum design are to facilitate independent scientific thinking,
and to learn by doing research. There will be a single program without barriers between
disciplines.
The students will be accepted directly into an integrated doctoral program leading to a
postdoctoral career path in leading research institutes and universities. The doctoral
program will have a standard enrollment period of five years, and will follow a coursebased study system. A three-term per year system will be used. The first two years will
comprise a combination of laboratory rotations and courses, designed to prepare the
students for their doctoral thesis work in a flexible way. In the second year the students
will choose a laboratory in which to undertake thesis research and will submit a Thesis
Proposal. An examination for progression to thesis research is held at the end of the
second year, based on the written Thesis Proposal and an Oral Examination that includes a
defense of the proposal and examination of fundamental knowledge in the field of the
research. In order to ensure the highest international standards an external examiner who
is expert in the field of the thesis study is a member of the examining panel. After
determination of readiness for thesis work the students will enter into a three-year period
of thesis research, which will conclude with examination of the thesis.
Students entering the program directly from undergraduate studies will normally take
about five years to complete their course of study. Those with a relevant Honors degree or
a Master’s degree in another area can finish in four years. Students entering with a
Master’s degree in the area they intend to specialize can finish in three years.

iii. Diploma Policy:
The Ph.D. degree is conferred by the University in recognition of completion by the
candidate of original research that makes a significant contribution to scientific
knowledge. The degree is not awarded for completion of certain courses or a fixed period
of enrolment, or for directed work as a technician. The work for the degree consists of
original research and systematic studies that advance knowledge, conducted by the
candidate with an appropriate degree of independence. In addition, the candidate must
demonstrate the ability to communicate the results of their research and scholarship
effectively in both oral and written English. The candidate must present their work in a
thesis and defend it in an oral examination. A published paper or manuscript ready for
submission must be included as an appendix to the thesis. A candidate may not submit for
examination work that has been included in a thesis or dissertation that has been
previously submitted towards a degree qualification.
In order to ensure the highest international standards a Final Examination is held after
submission of the thesis. The Final Examination includes examination of the written thesis
by two external examiners of international standing in the field of the thesis research, who
also conduct an on-site oral examination.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.2.5. Transfer students
Students who have commenced studies at another university and wish to continue
their students at OIST and obtain the OIST PhD degree may, under special
circumstances, be admitted subject to meeting admission standards. Such cases may
arise, for example, when newly appointed faculty members with existing graduate
students are appointed at OIST before their students complete their studies. In such
cases OIST wishes to ensure the best possible outcome for the students and their
supervisors while preserving the high international standards of the graduate
program.
Transfer students should complete the application process in the same way as other
students but their folder should include a letter from the OIST faculty member
explaining the situation and recommending the student for the OIST graduate
program.
5.2.6. Registration
An applicant who has been admitted to the graduate program as a full-time
candidate for a PhD will become a student of the OIST Graduate School on the date
of first registration. Registration is a synonym for matriculation in this context.
Every student is required to register on admission to the Graduate School (Article
25 of the University Rules), and thereafter at the beginning of each academic year of
the graduate program.

Flexibility in time of admission or registration may be of advantage. For example,
there may be advantages to the Graduate School in recruitment of excellent
students, and there may be benefits for the academic progress of the student.
Variations in time of registration may be allowed by the President at the request of
the Dean of the Graduate School.
For graduate students registering for the doctoral program leading to a PhD, the
following conditions apply:
i
ii

iii

Registration is restricted to full-time candidates.
A full-time candidate may hold an external scholarship or receive
financial support from OIST, or a combination of both, to enable
him or her to study on a full-time basis, but may not otherwise hold
employment.
The full-time status of the student must be confirmed in a written
declaration signed by the student and the Dean of the Graduate
School.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

In order to register, the student, must submit all forms in complete form to the
Student Support section.
On registration a “registered student record” will be created for the student in the
student record system. This record will be the official record of the student and will
link to all other records including student academic record, progress reports,
financial support, and housing, etc.
If the student does not fulfill all the requirements for registration by the deadline
announced by the Office of the Graduate School, the admission will be automatically
cancelled, and the student will be notified of cancellation in a timely manner.
5.2.7.
Student ID Card
Students are required to carry a valid Student ID Card to access OIST facilities
(doorways, classrooms, laboratories, administrative offices, libraries, etc.), and
must present it when certificates are issued or when OIST staff asks for
identification. Short-term students will be provided with a temporary Student ID
card.
5.2.7.1.
Card Issue and Return
When the student has been registered by the Graduate School, he or she
will be issued with a Student ID Card. The card remains the property of
the Graduate School, and must be returned upon completion of the
period of study.
The card becomes invalid once the student is no longer a registered
student at OIST.
5.2.7.2.
Access
Entry to general laboratory areas is only permitted after the student has
successfully completed the induction program during Enrollment Week,
or similar (see PRP 5.2.8). Additional access to specific more restricted
areas will only be made available after the appropriate safety and
equipment training has been provided. Such access will only be provided
while the student has a need to enter those particular restricted areas.

by other persons, whether or not those persons are themselves authorized
to have access to OIST facilities. Cards may not be copied, reverseengineered, distributed without permission, or cryptanalyzed. Cards
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

remain the property of OIST even when invalidated. The Dean of the
Graduate School may take disciplinary action in the event that these
provisions are not followed.
5.2.8. Induction program
Students registered as full time OIST PhD students complete an induction program
during Enrollment Week (the first week of the first term of the Academic Year). This
program includes briefings on the PhD program, the mentoring and guidance of
students, and student support, as well as training in the use of OIST facilities such
as the IT infrastructure, the library, and the laboratories. Essential safety training to
operate in the research laboratories and a preliminary health screen are mandatory
before entry to the laboratory areas is provided.
OIST PhD students arriving outside of Enrollment Week and incoming special
students may take this induction program at other times of the year more suitable
to their arrival time. However, no laboratory access can be provided to students who
have not completed this or a similar induction program.

publication; and
satisfies the examiners in an oral examination in matters relevant
to the subject of the thesis.

5.3.1.
Period of study
The standard period of study is 5 years but may vary according to the level of
preparation of the student and the progress of their research. The period of study
may be reduced if the student has previously undertaken study that provides
appropriate preparation.
5.3.1.1.
Admission with BSc.
The period of study for a student entering with a first degree is 5 years.
5.3.1.2.
Admission with MSc.
A student who has already obtained an MSc or has significant,
documented research experience may enter directly into the second or
third years of the program. Such a student will be required to complete
an approved course of studies.
5.3.1.3.
Minimum period of study
The minimum period of study is stipulated in Article 35 of the University
Rules.
5.3.1.4.
Extension to the standard period of study
In exceptional circumstances the period of study may be extended
beyond the standard period of 5 years. Extension requires approval of the
Dean of the Graduate School. In case of extension of the period of study,
extension of financial support is not automatically granted. (see financial
support section [link: 5.4.1])
5.3.1.5.
Maximum period of study
The maximum permitted period of study is 10 years, including Study
Leave and Annual Leave [link: 5.3.17].
5.3.2. Academic year and dates of terms
The academic year begins in September each year. The school year is composed of
three terms, with nominally 15 weeks of scheduled teaching in each term. This
schedule was chosen in order to give enough time for completion of a meaningful
project in each Research Rotation (See Article 17 of the OIST University Rules).
5.3.3. Course work requirements
The first two years of the integrated 5-year doctoral program comprise a
combination of Research Rotations and courses, designed to prepare the student for
his or her doctoral thesis work in a flexible way. In the first two years of the program
students will undertake an individualized study program constructed from a
combination of courses.
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.3.4. Course credits
The number of credits assigned to each course is stipulated in the Schedule of
Courses. Students will be required to accrue at least 30 points before graduation.
Courses include Professional Development, Basic, Advanced, and Research Courses.
The subtotal of Professional Development, Basic, and Advanced courses amounts to
a value of 20 points. Research courses include Rotations and a Thesis Proposal
amounting to a total value of 10 points. International Workshop Participation may
provide additional points. Credits may be awarded for graduate courses completed
at other universities or at OIST prior to admission (Chapter 5.6.2).
5.3.5. Mandatory Courses
To maintain flexibility in the curriculum the number of mandatory courses (apart
from the required research courses: Rotation and Thesis Proposal) is limited to two,
each worth one credit. These courses are Professional Development I and II. These
Professional Development Courses are designed to develop essential knowledge,
experience, and abilities for successful completion of the graduate program and to
prepare the graduate for a career in leading international academic or industrial
research laboratories.
5.3.6. Basic and Advanced Courses
Each student will normally take at least 4 Basic courses and 4 Advanced courses.
In general, Basic and Advanced courses are worth two credits. Information about
Courses is provided in the Schedule of Courses [link:
https://groups.oist.jp/grad/courses-term-0] and Course Approval sections [link:
5.3.10]. Course advising [link: 5.3.10.] is undertaken by an individual Academic
Mentor for each student, to provide an individualized course of studies.
5.3.6.1.
Research Rotations
Rotations form a major part of the student’s work in the first year of the
graduate program. In each rotation, the student will spend one term
undertaking a specific project and will then move on to a different
research unit. The Rotations provide a variety of experience in different
laboratories that will broaden the student’s understanding of different
disciplines, techniques, and ways of thinking. Rotations may include
theoretical work or modeling as well as laboratory benchwork. They are
intended to help the student select the most appropriate research unit
and research question for their thesis research. Students will typically
complete three Rotations before deciding on a thesis topic.
Three Research Rotations are always required, with a total point value of
9 points. There may be exceptions to this requirement in the case of
equivalent prior research experience, in which case credit may be
awarded in increments of 3 points as a cross-credit [link: 5.6.2.]. In
general, not more than 6 points can be cross-credited for rotations, so
that all students must complete at least one rotation.
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

The choice of Rotations is part of the approved course taken by the
student, and requires discussion with the Academic Mentor [link: 5.3.10].
The number of students who may take a rotation in a given research unit
is limited to 2 and not all choices will necessarily be available at a given
time. Students should list in order of preference 5 rotations on the
application form submitted with their proposed course for approval by
the Dean of the Graduate School. Their top 3 will be accommodated
whenever possible. If not possible, the committee will look further
along their list to ensure they can complete their rotations during the first
year.
Each Rotation entails completion of a meaningful project. The Professor
in charge of the host research unit will assign the project topic, taking into
account the interests of the student and the capabilities of the research
unit. In the course of each rotation the student is required to:
i. Write a rotation project proposal,
ii. Complete the proposed project in the research unit,
iii. Make an oral presentation to the research unit members,
and
iv. Submit a written report on the project.
Rotations are evaluated by the Professor in charge of the research unit,
and the student’s report together with the evaluation is forwarded to the
Academic Services Section. The student’s progress and performance in
each Rotation will be discussed in the Curriculum and Examination
Committee to ensure cooperation among faculty members in facilitating
individual student progress.
5.3.7.
PhD Thesis Proposal
Students are required to complete a PhD thesis proposal, which is worth one credit.
For details, see PRP 5.3.11.
5.3.8. Workload
The maximum the number of courses that can be taken in any one term is four.
However, students will not normally take more than two Basic or Advanced Courses
per term, in order to leave time for independent studies, reading, and research work
during Rotations.

5.3.10. Course advising
The particular selection of courses taken by any student is based on their educational
background, intentions, and experience. Apart from mandatory Professional
Development courses, there are no compulsory course requirements.
In such a flexible program, in which each student has an individualized program,
excellent advice in course selection from an experienced advisor is essential. To
provide this advice each student will have an independent Academic Mentor.
5.3.10.1.
Appointment of Academic Mentor
An Academic Mentor (also called General Advisor) is assigned to each
student from the time of admission. The Academic Mentor is required to
work carefully with the student to select courses and Research Rotations
that reinforce the foundations of the field of study and also provide the
breadth of study necessary to develop the ability to collaborate effectively
across traditional boundaries. The Academic Mentor for each student will
be appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School, with advice from the

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Academic Services Section. The Academic Mentor should have the
following characteristics:
i Significant prior experience in course advising and
supervision of graduate thesis research. New Faculty may
gain experience in course advising and supervision by
serving on thesis committees as a committee member.
ii High level of competence in the field, able to give advice to
the student on the choice of courses that will prepare them
for their PhD thesis research.
iii Be a disinterested party charged with working for the best
interests of the student
The Academic Mentor will continue to play a general mentoring role for
the duration of the student’s studies at OIST. The Academic Mentor
cannot also be the same student’s Thesis Supervisor. If a student elects to
undertake their thesis research in the research unit of the Academic
Mentor, a new Academic Mentor shall be appointed.
5.3.10.2.
Duties of Academic Mentor in development of Course Plan
The Academic Mentor and student together will formulate a plan of
courses and Rotations for the first two years. The course plan will take
into account any previously established credits, specific experience and
research interests of the student. The Academic Mentor will guide the
students to choose Rotations that include exposure to both experimental
and theoretical approaches, and an interdisciplinary experience.
5.3.10.3.
Approval of Course Plan
The course plan will be submitted to the Dean of the Graduate School on
the required form. Each individual’s course plan will be finally approved
by the Dean of the Graduate School.
5.3.10.4.
Approval of Research Rotations
Research Rotations are approved by the Dean of the Graduate School
taking into account the student preferences, and availability of rotations.
5.3.10.5.
Course assessment
Each course will be assessed as specified in the course. Examiners may
examine by means of written, practical, or oral test, or by continuous
assessment, or by any combination of these. Examination scripts and
reports must be written in English.
A student who is unable to complete an assessment because of genuine
impairment may be permitted by the Dean of the Graduate School to
complete a supplementary assessment. In such cases an application for
special consideration must be submitted within 48 hours of the
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

assessment on the appropriate form.
There shall be no appeal against examination results. However,
complaints about examination results will be considered by the Dean of
the Graduate School and scripts will be checked for errors in marking. If
errors are detected marks may be corrected up or down with the
agreement of the examiner.
Formal assessment of courses will be coordinated by the Academic
Services section. The dates of examinations and due dates of major items
of assessment will be coordinated to avoid timetable clashes. Such dates
will be fixed at the start of each academic year and students will be
advised of the examination and assessment timetable at the start of the
year.
Examination questions must be provided to Academic Services at least
one month prior to the examination for preparation of examination
papers. Examinations will be invigilated. Entry to the examination rooms
will only be permitted for candidates enrolled in the course.
5.3.10.6.
Monitoring of student progress and student mentoring
In the first two years, before confirmation of the student to progress to
thesis research, the Academic Mentor will meet regularly with the student
to discuss progress or problems with Courses and Rotations. The grades
obtained in courses will be reported to the Academic Mentor and
Curriculum and Examination Committee by Academic Services. In cases
of difficulty the Academic Mentor will organize help and support for the
individual student as needed. If difficulties continue the Academic
Mentor has the responsibility of alerting the Dean of the Graduate School,
who may initiate proceedings related to poor progress or performance.
5.3.11. Qualifying for Progression to PhD Thesis Research
Before commencing PhD thesis research all OIST graduate students will be
evaluated by the Curriculum and Examinations Committee to determine if they are
qualified for PhD thesis work. To initiate this process the student prepares the PhD
thesis proposal, as described in Section [link: 5.3.11.3] after selecting a Thesis
Supervisor(s) and Research Unit, and nominates a Thesis Committee. The thesis
proposal, Thesis Supervisor, and Thesis Committee must be formally approved by
the Dean of the Graduate School before the student commences thesis research

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.3.11.1.
members

Nomination of Thesis Supervisor, and Thesis Committee

All students will be required to have a Thesis Committee - irrespective of
the seniority of the Thesis Supervisor - to provide oversight of the thesis
research supervision. The Thesis Committee will comprise the Thesis
Supervisor, the Academic Mentor, and the cosupervisor or the third
Thesis Committee member, selected from among OIST faculty members
by the student in consultation with the Thesis Supervisor. If the
cosupervisor is selected from faculty members external to OIST, an
additional Thesis Committee member also needs to be selected from
among OIST faculty members. The student is responsible for nominating
the Thesis Supervisor and may suggest names for the other committee
members. The thesis committee members should be nominated before
appointment of the Examination Panel for the thesis proposal. The
Academic Services Section will provide guidance and assistance to
students in relation to this process.
PhD Thesis Supervisors must be full-time faculty members. Adjunct and
visiting faculty members may be cosupervisors or Thesis Committee
members. Faculty external to the university may be cosupervisors
provided an institutional agreement exists with the university of the
external faculty member. Information about such agreements is available
from Academic Services.
5.3.11.2.
Process for Approval of Thesis Supervisor and Thesis
Committee Members
In consultation with the intended PhD Thesis Supervisor and Academic
Mentor, the student completes and submits the form for nominating
Thesis Supervisor [link: Preliminary Thesis Research Supervisor] to the
Graduate School. Furthermore, in consultation with the intended PhD
Thesis Supervisor, Academic Mentor and prospective members of the
Thesis Committee, the student completes and submits the form for
nominating Thesis Committee members [link: Thesis Proposal
Submission Cover Sheet] along with the thesis proposal to the Graduate
School. The Thesis Supervisor and Thesis Committee members for each
student will be appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School, with advice
from the Academic Services Section. If the proposed Thesis Supervisor is
the same person as the Academic Mentor, a new Academic Mentor will

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

be appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School to avoid any conflict
of interest.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.3.11.3.

PhD Thesis Proposal Requirement

The PhD thesis proposal is the student’s plan for their thesis research,
and forms an important part of the evaluation for progression to thesis
research. A positive outcome of the evaluation means that the proposal is
acceptable and that the Curriculum and Examinations Committee agrees
that the student is competent to proceed with the plan under the
supervision of the thesis committee. The thesis proposal must be the
student’s independent work in which the student makes an original
contribution to the development of the research question, design of the
research, and review of the literature. In the course of developing the
proposal the student is expected to discuss the intended research with the
thesis supervisor. The supervisor should advise the student on what is
possible in the research unit, and discuss the scientific questions, the
relevant existing work, and the research design and methods.
Students must write the thesis proposal in their own words. In referring
to the work of others correct citation and attribution of sources is
essential. Plagiarism by copying or paraphrasing is strictly forbidden and
if established may lead to a fail without further examination.
The student’s supervisor and proposed Thesis Committee must read the
proposal before it is submitted. The student’s Thesis Committee may give
feedback on one draft of the proposal and allow the student to make
necessary revisions before submission. When satisfied that the plan is
achievable and that the research goals are appropriate, the supervisor
and committee members indicate formal agreement by signing the cover
page. The proposal is then submitted for examination. The student must
defend the proposal in an oral examination.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.3.11.3.1. Format and Content of the Thesis Proposal
It is part of the student's training in research to prepare a concise,
rigorous, and scholarly thesis proposal and present it in the correct
format. There is no strict length requirement for the thesis proposal.
It is anticipated that most students will need 8,000-10,000 words
(about twenty pages of text) to adequately explain the motivation and
goals of their project, review the relevant literature, and describe
progress to date. However, concise proposals are encouraged, and a
proposal of 5,000 words, which covered all these points, would be
perfectly acceptable. The proposal should contain the following
sections:
i.

Front Page. This should include the name and logo of the
OIST Graduate University, the words “PhD Thesis
Proposal”, the title of the thesis proposal, the names of the
student, primary supervisor (and co-supervisor if there is
one), and the month and year of submission of the thesis
proposal.

ii.

Abstract. This should be a single paragraph of not more than
500 words, which concisely summarizes the entire proposal.

iii.

List of Abbreviations

iv.

Introduction and Literature Review. This should include a
statement of the problem, the overall aims, and background
to the research including a review of relevant existing work
(literature review). The literature review should be of
publishable quality and provide a concise, scholarly review
of the literature explaining the background to the proposed
research. The review should provide the context for the aims
of the proposed research in relation to existing work on the
topic.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

v.

Research Plan. This should begin with the specific aims of
the research and provide a concrete plan for completion of
the research including the design and methods. This section
should include an explanation of how the methods will
address the aims and the significance of the results for the
field.

vi.

Progress Report. This should be a report on the research
achievements of the student in the laboratory of the
proposed supervisor during preliminary thesis research. The
report should not duplicate material previously submitted
for evaluation as part of a previous degree, but may include
work completed during rotations at OIST. The report may
include examples of results obtained with the methods
proposed. It is understood that results may not be available
in projects requiring, for example, development of methods,
sample preparation, or recruitment of participants, in which
case other evidence of progress should be reported.

vii.

Bibliography. The bibliography should include all references
cited in the text and should not include references that have
not been cited. In preparing the bibliography, students may
use any of the conventional styles of referencing that include
the titles of articles, such as the Harvard, Vancouver or ACS
systems. However, the style chosen must be used
consistently and correctly throughout, both for in-text
citations, and formatting of bibliographic entries

viii.

Appendices. These are optional and should only be used if
necessary.

The examiners commit to read the proposal, but the Curriculum and
Examinations Committee reserves the right to require students to rewrite
excessively long, or poorly constructed, thesis proposals, without
forwarding them to examiners. The student cannot assume that the
examiners will read the optional appendices.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

The complete doctoral thesis proposal document must be submitted to
the Graduate School by the due date as nominated by the Dean, normally
no later than four weeks (28 days) prior to the oral defense. An
emergency exception to the standard due date deadline can be granted by
the Dean on the basis of a written request from the supervisor.

5.3.11.4.
Examination and Defence of Thesis Proposal
An Examination Panel for the thesis proposal comprises three members:
an External Examiner, an Internal Examiner, and a Chair appointed by
the Curriculum and Examinations committee. The Examination Panel
will conduct a three-hour oral examination that will include a defense of
the thesis proposal. The Examination Panel will include an External
Examiner who is expert in the field of the proposed thesis and external to
OIST. Normally the examination will be conducted in person at OIST but
if this is not possible the Dean of the Graduate School may permit
electronic participation by audiovisual link. The Curriculum and
Examinations Committee appoints the External Examiner taking into
account nominations provided by the proposed supervisor. Similar
conflicts of interest precaution apply as outlined in 5.3.13.3.1 below. The
Examination Panel also includes an Internal Examiner from OIST faculty
members, who is appointed by the Curriculum and Examinations
committee. An OIST faculty member with knowledge of OIST standards
and regulations concerning thesis proposal examinations is nominated
by the Curriculum and Examinations committee and will chair the
Examination Panel. The Examination Panel will not include the proposed
thesis supervisor or student’s mentor. The Thesis Supervisor and other
members of the Thesis Committee may attend the oral examination as
observers but should not participate in the examination.
5.3.11.4.1. Conduct of the Examination
The only material normally permitted in the examination room is
the thesis proposal itself. Additional material such as copies of
additional results figures developed since the thesis proposal was
submitted, are permitted provided they are supplied to the Chair at
least one week in advance, and the Chair agrees to their inclusion.
The Chairperson starts the examination by announcing the start of
the examination and explaining the examination process to the
student and examiners. The Chairperson then invites the student to
give a concise summary of the research proposal, which should
normally take less than 15 minutes. The use of slides or other
material for the presentation is not permitted. However, the

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

student may refer to a hard copy of the thesis proposal during the
examination. A white board and pens are also provided.
After the summary, the Chairperson invites the External Examiner
to examine the student. The Internal Examiner may follow the
External Examiner or, as appropriate, join the discussion with the
student. As the expert in the field of the thesis proposal, the
External Examiner is expected to play the principal role in the
examination.
It is expected that the examination will comprise a balance of
roughly equal parts: (1) defense of the thesis proposal and (2)
examination of fundamental knowledge in the field or fields of
study relevant to the thesis topic.
In the defense of the thesis proposal (part 1), the student is expected
to demonstrate the necessary advanced knowledge and
understanding to undertake the proposed thesis research and show
their original and independent contribution to the proposal and the
research question.
In the oral examination (part 2), the student is expected to
demonstrate adequate fundamental knowledge in the field or fields
of study relevant to the thesis topic, and the ability to organize,
apply and convey that knowledge effectively.
In the conduct of the examination it is envisaged that part 2 will
flow naturally from part 1. A rigid division into parts is not
necessary and the balance of time spent on each part, while
nominally equal, may be varied at the discretion of the examiners.
The examination shall not continue for more than three hours
maximum, but may be concluded sooner if the examiners are
satisfied that they have sufficiently examined the student and are
able to make a recommendation. The Chairperson formally
concludes the examination when the allowed time has elapsed or
the examiners have indicated they have no further questions.
After the examination, the External Examiner and Internal
Examiner independently provide brief written reports on the
examination to the Chairperson within one week of the examination.
The Chairperson then forwards the reports to the Curriculum and
Examinations Committee. The report shall remain
confidential and shall not be released to the student until
after the Curriculum and Examinations Committee has
formally decided on the outcome of the examination.
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

The examiners’ report is required to include one of the following
possible recommendations listed below:
i.

ii.

iii.

Pass. The examiners recommend that the student be advanced to
candidacy. The examiners may recommend additional course work
or stipulate minor revisions to the thesis proposal.
Defer. This outcome is possible only if the student’s academic
preparation is sufficient, and the thesis proposal is not acceptable in
its present form but could be acceptable pending major revisions. The
thesis proposal must be re-examined in a second oral examination.
In such case the Examiner’s report shall itemize the deficiencies of
the thesis proposal that need to be addressed in the revisions, and any
deficiencies in the scope and depth of the student’s knowledge that
require remediation.
Fail. This is the outcome when academic preparation is not sufficient
or the thesis proposal is not suitable for re-examination, or has not
met the required standard on re-examination. No re-examination is
allowed in the case of a fail outcome.

5.3.11.5.

Evaluation for Progression to PhD Thesis Research

The purpose of evaluating qualification for progression to PhD thesis
research is to determine whether the student has an adequate
fundamental knowledge in the field or fields of study relevant to the
thesis topic, and can organize, apply and convey that knowledge
effectively. The Curriculum and Examinations Committee will make this
evaluation taking into account the completed program of study and the
student’s performance in courses and rotations at OIST, the thesis
proposal, and the student’s performance in an examination. The thesis
proposal forms an important part of the evaluation. The thesis proposal
must be the student’s independent work and clearly show the original
contribution of the student to the research question. The evaluation may
occur when requested by the student and normally before the end of the
second year of study, and at the latest within 12 months of the start of
preliminary thesis research. When evaluating the student, the
Curriculum and Examinations Committee will consider the following
materials:
i.

The student’s PhD thesis proposal.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

ii.

A report from the examining panel as separately described
(5.3.11.3).

iii.

The student’s academic record at OIST.

iv.
v.

Write-ups of Rotations.
An Endorsement of the thesis proposal from the proposed
thesis supervisor, the student’s academic mentor, and other
members of the intended thesis committee, on the prescribed
Thesis Proposal Submission Cover Sheet.
Further material deemed relevant to the evaluation.

vi.

At the next available meeting of the Curriculum and Examinations
Committee after the examination, the committee considers the reports
from the examiners and makes a recommendation. The Curriculum and
Examinations Committee will reach one of the three decisions listed below
and record the decision in the student’s academic record:
i.
ii.

iii.

Pass. The student is advanced to candidacy. The committee
may require additional course work or stipulate minor revisions
to the thesis proposal.
Defer. This outcome is possible only if the student’s academic
preparation is sufficient, and the thesis proposal is not
acceptable in its present form but could be acceptable pending
major revisions. The thesis proposal must be re-examined in a
second oral examination after which the committee must reach
a decision of either pass or fail. The committee will stipulate a
deadline for submission of a revised proposal and date of reexamination. If the student fails to resubmit by the deadline the
outcome will change to fail.
Fail. This is the outcome when academic preparation is not
sufficient or the thesis proposal is not suitable for reexamination, or has not met the required standard on reexamination. No re-examination is allowed in the case of a fail
outcome.

This outcome is sent to the student and the Thesis Committee as soon as
it becomes available, together with the reports of the examiners. If
revisions are required, a timeline for their completion is described in the
outcome letter. Revisions must be submitted by the deadline, for
consideration by the responsible person (usually the Examiner or Chair).
Once revisions have been accepted, the student is notified after ratification
at the next available meeting of the Curriculum and Examinations
Committee.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Procedures for appeal against the outcome of the evaluation are separately
described (5.3.11.8).

5.3.11.6.

Exit with MSc (“Non-continuation” outcome of evaluation for
progression).

A student who, after evaluation for progression to PhD thesis research,
fails to meet requirements for progression to PhD thesis research may
submit a thesis for consideration for award of the MSc degree in
accordance with Article 37, paragraph 3 of the University Rules. An MSc
may be awarded if the candidate has successfully completed the following
minimum requirements:
i. at least 30 points (20 from courses, 10 from research work),
ii. submission of a thesis describing their own research work at a level
judged to be suitable for the award of MSc by a panel of examiners
including at least one external examiner.
There is a time limit in such cases. The student must achieve the
necessary course credits and submit their MSc Thesis for examination
within six months of being informed of the outcome of the Evaluation.
The examining panel will include an external examiner, an internal
examiner, and a chair appointed for this purpose by the Curriculum and
Examination committee. The examiners will examine the written thesis
and submit a report within 3 months of receipt of the thesis, including a
recommendation of either “passed” or “failed”. The Curriculum and
Examination committee reviews the recommendation and considers
whether all academic requirements for the award of the degree have been
satisfied. In the case of a “pass” outcome the procedures for conferment
of the degree (5.3.15) shall be followed. In the case of a “fail” outcome the
Individual Student Record shall be updated with an entry on the next day,
stating that the outcome is “fail ” . At the time when the individual
Student Record is updated, the candidate is sent a letter advising of the
outcome.
5.3.11.7. Exit with MSc prior to progression to PhD thesis research
Under exceptional circumstances, when deemed necessary by the Dean
of the Graduate School, a student who, prior to evaluation for progression
to PhD thesis research, requests early exit from the program may be
allowed to submit a thesis for award of the MSc degree in accordance with
Article 37, paragraph 3 of the University Rules. Early exit must be
requested within two years of enrolment and approved by the Dean of the

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Graduate School. An MSc may be awarded if the candidate successfully
completes the following minimum requirements:
i. At least 30 points (20 from courses, 10 from research work).
ii. Submission of a thesis describing their own research work at a level
judged to be suitable for the award of MSc by a panel of examiners
including at least one external examiner.
iii. Having been enrolled in the University for at least two years.
The student must achieve the necessary course credits and submit their
MSc Thesis for examination before the end of the third year of enrolment.
The examining panel will include an external examiner, an internal
examiner, and a chair appointed for this purpose by the Curriculum and
Examination committee. The examiners will examine the written thesis
and submit a report within 3 months of receipt of the thesis, including a
recommendation of either “passed” or “failed”. The Curriculum and
Examination committee reviews the recommendation and considers
whether all academic requirements for the award of the degree have been
satisfied.
5.3.11.8. Appeals procedure
A student who has failed the qualifying examination (or MSc thesis
examination) may lodge an appeal. Grounds for appeal include incorrect
application of the procedures, but objections to the evaluations in the
assessment by the examiners, the decision of the Curriculum and
Examinations Committee, and the composition of the examining panel
are not a basis for appeal. The qualifying examination is a confidential
process, and this confidentiality must be maintained throughout any
appeals process. The appeal must be in writing, include a concise
statement of the reasons for the appeal, and be lodged with the Manager,
Academic Services, within 28 days of the date of the letter advising the
outcome of the qualifying examination. The appeal will be referred to the
Dean of Faculty Affairs, who will determine the course of action to be
undertaken, taking into consideration the grounds for the appeal stated
by the candidate. This may include a review of the examination process.
The Dean of Faculty Affairs will determine the outcome of the appeal as
either:
i.The procedures for the qualifying examination were applied correctly,
and the appeal is unsuccessful.
ii.The procedures for the qualifying examination were not applied
correctly, but the variation in procedures did not influence the
outcome of the examination, and the appeal is unsuccessful.
iii.The procedures for the qualifying examination were not applied
correctly, and the variation in procedures did influence the outcome of
the examination, and the appeal is successful. In this case, the Dean of
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Faculty Affairs will determine further action to be taken, which may
include re-examination.
The outcome of the appeal will be determined within 28 days of the date
the written appeal was received by the Office of Academic Services.
5.3.12. Monitoring the student’s progress in research
From the commencement of the thesis research period, the Thesis Supervisor will
take primary responsibility for monitoring progress of the student, assisted by the
Thesis Committee. The Academic Mentor will continue to act as a support person
and an advisor who can act in a confidential manner in case of problems between
the student and the Thesis Supervisor.
5.3.12.1.
Research progress reports
Confirmed students are required to submit an annual progress report on
the progress of the student’s thesis research. The student will prepare the
report, which will be endorsed by all members of the Thesis Committee,
and forwarded to the Dean of the Graduate School.
Satisfactory progress is required for continuation in the program. In case
of lack of progress or poor quality of research, the Dean of the Graduate
School may intervene and suggest solutions. If the lack of progress or
poor quality of research continues, the Dean of the Graduate School may,
in consultation with the Curriculum and Examination Committee, order
discontinuation.
5.3.12.2.
Discontinuation
A candidature may be discontinued:
i if academic progress is not satisfactory; or
ii if the student has failed to meet the requirements as stipulated
elsewhere [link: 5.4 ].
5.3.13. Ph.D Degree Completion
The Ph.D. degree is conferred by the University in recognition of completion by the
candidate of original research that makes a significant contribution to scientific
knowledge. The degree is not awarded for completion of certain courses or a fixed
period of enrolment, or for directed work as a technician. The work for the degree
consists of original research and systematic studies that advance knowledge,
conducted by the candidate with an appropriate degree of independence. In
addition, the candidate must demonstrate the ability to communicate the results of
their research and scholarship effectively in both oral and written English. The
candidate must present their work in a thesis and defend it in an oral examination.
A candidate may not submit for examination work that has been included in a thesis
or dissertation that has been previously submitted towards a degree qualification.
Course credit requirements are listed in PRP 5.3.13.7.
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.3.13.1.
Thesis Requirements
The thesis must present original research that makes a significant
contribution to scientific knowledge. The thesis must form a coherent
narrative that includes a statement of the problem, a scholarly review of
the relevant literature, and must present, in detail, the methods, results,
discussion and conclusions of the research. A collection of published
articles, irrespective of their impact on science, falls well short of what
will be considered acceptable. The thesis must be formatted in chapters
and submitted according to the OIST Guidelines on the Preparation of
Theses (“Guidelines”).
Students are strongly advised to publish peer-reviewed articles in
international journals based on their thesis work in a timely fashion and
preferably before submitting the thesis. Such publication of thesis
research is evidence of a significant scientific contribution that will be
taken into account by thesis examiners, and is essential for future career
prospects. Published, archived or submitted articles must be included as
an appendix of the written examination version of thesis. In the absence
of a published, archived or submitted article, the thesis for examination
must append at least one manuscript, drafted by the student, of
publication quality and ready for journal submission. Previously
published papers and manuscripts for submission must not be included
in the final version of the thesis, for copyright reasons.
When papers based on work completed as part of the PhD thesis are
submitted, are in press, or in print, it may be possible to modify and
include material from them as chapters in the thesis, providing that the
thesis as a whole presents a coherent account of the research. For details
concerning these matters refer to the Guidelines.
5.3.13.2.
Final Examination
A candidate is examined both on the written thesis and in an oral
examination.
The examination process is strictly confidential.
The candidate must submit to the Graduate School written Notice of
Intent to Submit a Thesis with enough time for the examination to be
arranged before the proposed submission date.
The Graduate School will provide guidance on the time required in each
case. Before submission of the thesis, the Graduate School must confirm
that the course credits necessary for graduation have been completed.
If there are insufficient course credits, the required additional credits
must be completed before the final examination.
5.3.13.3.
Appointment of the Thesis Examination Panel
After receiving the Notice of Intent to Submit a Thesis, the Curriculum
and Examinations Committee (CEC) will appoint thesis examiners from
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

within and outside the University, to form a Thesis Examination Panel,
as follows:
i.
Two Examiners selected from two different working-countries, who
are expert in the field of the proposed thesis and external to OIST. The
CEC appoints the examiners taking into account nominations provided
by the Thesis Supervisor. The CEC is responsible for determining if the
nominated examiner is expert in the field of the proposed thesis research,
taking into account the publications of the examiner in international peer
reviewed journals.
ii.
A Chair selected from the OIST faculty members with knowledge
OIST standards and regulations concerning PhD thesis examinations.
The Thesis Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the nominated
examiners meet the specified conditions. The Academic Services Section
of the Graduate School is responsible for checking that the specified
conditions are satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied, the
nomination shall not be submitted to the CEC, and the Supervisor shall
be advised on the grounds for declining the examiner and asked to
nominate a new examiner by the Academic Services Section.
The CEC may alternatively appoint an examiner who has not been
nominated by the Supervisor.
5.3.13.3.1 Conflicts of interest in examinations
The CEC will not appoint examination panel members who have
or appear to have conflicts of interest.
For OIST faculty
members, a conflict of interest is deemed to exist if the faculty
member is involved in the supervision of the thesis research of the
candidate, or is collaborating in the research project of the
candidate. For non-OIST faculty members a conflict of interest is
deemed to exist if they:
i.
Are involved in the research
ii.
Have current collaborations with members of the thesis
laboratory, or previous collaborations in the past 5 years.
iii. Have had prior or ongoing contact with the supervisor that
may appear to compromise objectivity, such as having been in the
same department as the supervisor, having been a thesis or
postdoctoral supervisor (or vice versa), or having joint
publications or grants with the supervisor in the past 5 years
iv.
Have had prior contact with the candidate that may appear
to compromise objectivity, such as having been in the same
department as the candidate, having supervised the candidate in
academic or project work, or having joint publications or grants
with the candidate at any time.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.3.13.4.

Examination of the Written Thesis

The two external examiners read the thesis, separately prepare a report
and make a recommendation from the following choices:
i.
Proceed to oral examination (no revisions, or minor revisions
required).
ii.
Defer (minor revisions required). The thesis as presented does not
meet the required standard but has the potential to do so if adequately
revised. Reexamination of the written thesis is required before oral
examination.
iii. Consider for an MSc degree [see: 5.3.13.4.1]. The thesis does not
contain material sufficient for a PhD degree but qualifies for an MSc.
iv. Fail.
Examiners submit their report and recommendation to the Chair of the
Thesis Examination Panel, through the Graduate School, at least 7 days
prior to the scheduled oral examination. The Chair reviews the
recommendations. Where necessary, the Chair may formally seek advice
related to the thesis research from other OIST faculty with relevant
knowledge of the field.
If both examiners recommend (i) the student is permitted to proceed to
the oral examination.
If one or more examiner selects either (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Chair convenes
a meeting of the Thesis Examination Panel by teleconference to
determine a recommendation, which is passed to the Curriculum and
Examinations Committee along with the examiners’ individual reports.
The Curriculum and Examinations Committee then decides on the course
of action from among the listed options (above).
In the case of Defer, the thesis must be re-examined after the revisions
have been completed. Examiners then choose a recommendation of:
i. Proceed to oral examination
ii. Consider for an MSc degree (see 5.3.13.4.1)
iii. Fail
In all cases the examiners' reports will be retained by the Chair until after
the oral examination, at which time they will be transmitted to the
student as outlined in PRP 5.3.13.5.
5.3.13.4.1 Exit with MSc (“Award lesser degree” outcome of PhD
thesis examination)

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

A student who fails to meet requirements for the award of a PhD
may be awarded the degree of MSc on the recommendation of the
Thesis Examination Panel, provided they have fulfilled the
necessary requirements set out in PRP 5.3.13.7.
5.3.13.5.

Oral Examination

It is a requirement that all examiners participate in the oral examination.
Exceptionally, if an examiner is not available in Okinawa at a time
convenient for a meeting of the Thesis Examination Panel, the Dean of
the Graduate School can approve remote participation of an examiner by
teleconferencing.
The examination is conducted in two parts:
An open presentation. This is a 45-minute presentation of the thesis work
followed by a 10-minute question period. The external examiners form
part of the audience but must not ask questions nor begin the
examination at this point.
An oral examination. Immediately after the research presentation, the
student and the Examination Panel conduct the oral examination in
private, for up to two hours. The Thesis Supervisor and other members
of the Thesis Committee may attend the oral examination as observers
but must not participate in the examination, nor take part in discussion.
After the oral examination the Thesis Examination Panel confers
privately. The Examiners may modify their reports in light of the oral
examination or confirm there are no changes. The Examination Panel
then determine a recommendation from the following options, using the
standard form provided by the Graduate School.
i. Pass
ii. Pass subject to satisfactory revision
iii. Defer and reexamine
iv. Consider for an MSc degree [see: PRP 5.3.13.4.1],
v. Fail
In the case of a “Pass” outcome, the student is informed by the Dean of
the Graduate School and must lodge the final version of the thesis with
the Graduate School as an electronic document, ready for publication in
the OIST institutional repository.
In the case of “Pass subject to satisfactory revision” outcome the report
specifies the revisions to be made, which may be by reference to
individual examiner’s reports. The Dean of the Graduate School informs
the student of the required revisions.
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

After the student has made the revisions the Chair of the Thesis
Examination Panel approves the final version of the thesis or, if the
revisions are unsatisfactory, returns it for further corrections. If
necessary the Chair may ask the external examiners to evaluate the
revisions. When the final version of the thesis has been approved the
student is informed by the Dean of the Graduate School and must lodge
the final version of the thesis with the Graduate School as an electronic
document, ready for publication in the OIST institutional repository.
Students are required to remain at OIST until the final version of the
thesis has been accepted by the Graduate School.
In the case of a "Defer" recommendation, the report specifies the reasons
for the defer recommendation and the required revisions, and the student
is referred to the Curriculum and Examinations Committee for setting a
new timeline for revision and reexamination. Where possible, the same
examiners are involved in the reexamination of the written thesis and the
oral defense.
In the case of a "Consider for MSc" recommendation or a "Fail"
recommendation, the Report specifies the reasons for the outcome and
the student is referred to the Curriculum and Examinations Committee.
The Curriculum and Examinations Committee may decide to consider for
an MSc degree [link: PRP 5.3.13.4.1] or fail the student.
A student who has failed the thesis examination may lodge an appeal. The
procedures for an appeal are separately stipulated in PRP 5.3.11.8.
5.3.13.6.

Public presentation

There is no requirement for a public defense of the degree thesis as part
of Doctor the examination process. As part of Philosophy. their
professional development candidates are expected to give a final
presentation of their research for the OIST community, but this does not
form part of the examination.
5.3.13.7 Summary of Completion Requirements
In order to graduate with the PhD degree, a student must have been
registered as a full-time student for a minimum enrolment period
stipulated in Article 35 of the University Rules and successfully met the
following minimum requirements:

Conferment of Degree

On confirmation of receipt of the final version of the thesis via the
Graduate School, the secretary of the Curriculum and Examinations
Committee passes to the faculty assembly the recommendation to award
the degree. The recommendation shall be sent electronically. If there are
no objections within three working days, the recommendation shall be
considered as having been confirmed by the Faculty Assembly. In the
case that there are valid objections the matter shall be put on the agenda
for the next Faculty Assembly meeting, and the student and members of
the thesis committee shall be informed. The Dean of the Graduate School
shall prepare a recommendation for the Faculty Assembly after hearing
the nature of the objection.
Once the Faculty Assembly has approved the recommendation, the
minutes of the Faculty Assembly hold a record of the names of the
students, the date of conferment, and title of the thesis. The Individual
Student Record shall be updated with an entry by the end of the month

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

in which the Faculty Assembly approved, stating that all requirements for
the degree have been satisfied and the degree has been conferred. The
record includes the date, the title of the thesis, the name of the Thesis
Supervisor, and the names of the other members of the Thesis Committee.
At the time when the individual Student Record is updated, the student
is sent a letter confirming that the degree has been conferred and that the
student may receive their degree certificate at the next graduation
ceremony or “in absentia”. The degree certificate is presented by the
President at the graduation ceremony (see PRP 5.3.15.2). A student who
chooses to graduate in absentia is provided with the degree certificate
after the graduation ceremony. The format of the certificate is as per
Form 1 (for PhD Degree) and Form 2 (for MSc Degree) .

When a Doctoral degree is conferred, it shall be reported to the Minister
of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the abstract
of the thesis and the result of the examination shall be publicized on the
internet within 3 months following the day of the conferment of the
Doctoral degree.
The entire text of the thesis related to the conferment of the Doctoral
degree shall be published within one year following the day of the
conferment of the Doctoral degree; provided however, that this shall not
apply to the thesis published prior to the conferment of the Doctoral
degree.
The student may request that the full text not be published, and instead
only publish a summary of the contents of the thesis in lieu of the entire
text of thesis when there is significant reason and with approval of the
Supervisor. In this case, the University will make available for inspection
the entire text of the thesis in response to a request, in hard copy and on
University library premises. When necessary for intellectual property
protection or other reasons, this inspection will be subject to a nondisclosure agreement. When the Dean of the Graduate School judges that
the significant reason no longer exists, the entire text of thesis related to

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

the conferment of the Doctoral degree shall be published through the
medium specified by the university.

5.3.15.3.

Graduation Ceremony

The University holds an annual Graduation Ceremony, to which all
eligible PhD graduates from the preceding year are invited. The President
will present those graduates in attendance at the ceremony with their
degree certificates in the presence of the assembled faculty of the
University. Graduates who choose to graduate in absentia will be
mentioned at the ceremony and their certificate will be sent to them by
mail.
OIST official academic dress comprises a black gown with red border and
white piping, together with a black velvet tam and tassel. PhD graduates
of the OIST Graduate University augment the university gown and tam
with a hood, presented at the graduation ceremony. Academic dress is
made available by the Graduate School for rent or purchase by faculty
members, students, and graduates. The rental fee covers cleaning and
other costs, while the purchase cost reflects the actual cost of academic
dress manufacture. Graduating students may elect to rent for the
graduation ceremony and purchase at a later date. Academic dress
rentals are not permitted for off-site use.
Under the OIST travel rules, the Graduate School will pay for airfare for
the OIST graduates attending the ceremony to receive their degree
certificate. In addition, the Graduate School will cover the cost of guest
rooms in Seaside House for the graduates and family members for their
accommodation if available.
5.3.16. Student professional development
5.3.16.1.
Careers Advice
The OIST Graduate School has a dedicated Careers Development
Coordinator in the Admissions and Career Development Section. The Careers
Development Coordinator provides individual careers advice, as well as
help with CV and resume writing, job searching and career exploration to
students.
5.3.16.2.
Teaching Assistantship
The OIST Graduate School offers OIST PhD students and Special
Research Students opportunities to gain experience and develop skills as
Teaching Assistants. Teaching Assistants may contribute to various
educational activities such as:
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

1.
Assisting an OIST faculty member in the delivery of an official OIST
Graduate School course. Teaching Assistants may contribute in activities
such as laboratory classes and tutorials and preparation of materials
under the supervision of the faculty member. It is expected that the OIST
faculty member is present for the scheduled teaching hours to provide
mentoring and quality control; this should not be used to replace faculty
in teaching. Selection as a Teaching Assistant for a course is decided by
the faculty member in charge of the course.
2.
Acting as tutors in OIST International Workshops and Courses, or
in preparatory or remedial courses for OIST students. Selection is
decided by the faculty member in charge of the Workshop or Course.
3.
Contributing to educational outreach activities such as open
campus, school visits, children’s science. Selection is decided by the
organizer of the outreach activity.
4.
Assisting in educational activities at other universities, by
agreement between the universities. Selection is decided by the graduate
school in consultation with the other university.
5.
Assisting in other educational activities organized by the Graduate
School.
Teaching experience is important for an academic career. The graduate
school will keep a record of Teaching Assistant activity for each student.
A record of teaching experience will form part of the Professional
Development course requirements.
Teaching Assistants are expected to prepare thoroughly for their teaching
activity by reading all materials and studying necessary background.
Preparation of material may be required. Attendance at training provided
as part of Professional Development courses is also expected. Because of
the course requirements in the first years of the PhD program, Teaching
Assistants will normally only be appointed after successfully completing
their qualifying examination.
Students wishing to apply for Teaching Assistant appointments should
discuss their request with the faculty member or organizer of educational
activity and submit a completed Teaching Assistant Application Form to
the Student Support desk. This form is necessary for recording the
Teaching Assistant activity of each student. The form should detail the
contact hours and be signed by the proposed supervisor. A CV should be
attached.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Service as a Teaching Assistant is normally unpaid because students
receive financial support by other mechanisms. Exceptional cases and
other necessary items are separately stipulated.

5.3.17. Leave of Absence and Holidays
Research study in the Graduate School is considered a year-round activity that
continues between teaching terms. A student who wishes to be absent from Okinawa
and / or the approved course of study and research, or who proposes to take
vacation, shall be required to submit a written application for leave of absence.
There are four types of leave of absence, namely, Annual Leave, Study Leave, Nonstudy Leave and Special Leave. Apart from Sick Leave, a student must seek and
receive approval BEFORE going on leave.
5.3.17.1.
Annual Leave
In addition to University Holidays (5.3.17.5), Students are granted 20
days of Annual Leave per Academic Year, adjusted pro rata from their
first day, or 10 days if the entire period of study is less than one year. At
the start of each Academic Year thereafter, students are granted an
additional 20 days Annual Leave. For students taking courses, this leave
must be taken in the designated break periods between terms; Annual
Leave will not usually be approved during term. For students engaged in
thesis research work, the approval of the Thesis Supervisor (or in the case
of Special Research Students, the University supervisor) is required for
Annual Leave, which may be taken during term time. Annual Leave newly
granted and not used in the current year will be carried over to the
following year. The carried over Annual Leave must be used prior to the
Annual Leave newly granted in the following year.
5.3.17.2.
Study Leave
A student may be granted Study Leave for the purposes of study while
taking approved courses at other institutions outside Okinawa. A student
may be granted Study Leave for the purpose of research outside Okinawa
only at a partner institution with which the University has entered into a
formal exchange agreement. Any period of Study Leave granted shall be
counted towards the period of study. Conference, summer school and
workshop attendance outside Okinawa, and field work are not normally
considered as Study Leave but as a business trip.
5.3.17.3.
Non-study leave
A student may request or be asked to take Non-study Leave when he /
she is best advised for personal, health, or other reasons to have time
completely away from his / her academic responsibilities. Under no
circumstances shall leave of absence under this category be granted on
each occasion or cumulatively for a period of more than two years for the
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

entire period of study. Any period of Non-study Leave granted shall result
in the extension of the period of study by the period of absence.
5.3.17.4.
Special Leave
Students may be granted Special Leave for a variety of reasons with
approval by the Graduate School. The table below indicates acceptable
reasons and length of leave:

5.3.18. Childbirth Accommodation Policy
The OIST Graduate University promotes diversity and supports balance in work
and family life. It recognizes the need to accommodate the demands on students
associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and the care of children. The University
encourages women to undertake postgraduate education and supports women who
decide to have children while at graduate school. It also recognizes the demands on
partners who share in the care of a newborn child, on parents who adopt, and
foster parents. The Childbirth Accommodation Policy comprises a set of measures
designed to accommodate these needs, supporting family life during graduate
studies.
The measures are designed to make it possible to maintain the mother’s full-time,
registered student status before and after childbirth, and to facilitate her return to
full participation in class work and research in a seamless manner. It is also
designed to support partners, adoptive and foster parents sharing in the care of a
newborn child.
This policy is intended to complement and not replace the communication and
cooperation between student and academic mentor, thesis supervisor, and course
coordinators in their good-faith efforts to accommodate the new family needs. It is
the intention of this policy to reinforce the importance of that cooperation, and to
provide support where needed to make that accommodation possible. A faculty
member may not discontinue supervising a student’s thesis research on the basis
of the student’s decision to give birth to, adopt or foster a child.
Summary of Provisions of the Childbirth Accommodation Policy
The Childbirth Accommodation Policy has four components:
(1) an Academic Accommodation Period of up to two consecutive academic
terms around the time of the birth, during which the student may postpone
course assignments, examinations, and other academic requirements;
(2) continuation of full-time registration as a graduate student with continued
access to OIST facilities and housing during the Academic Accommodation
Period;
(3) full financial support through the Academic Accommodation Period; and,
(4) leave from regular duties as a Research Assistant in accordance with the
Maternity Leave provisions for Full-time employees, as follows:
Prenatal Leave. Research Assistants who expect to give birth within 6 weeks
(14 weeks for multiple pregnancies) are granted prenatal maternity leave.
When the actual delivery is after the expected delivery date, the additional

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

days are included in the maternity leave.
Postpartum Leave. Research Assistants are granted 8-week paid postpartum
maternity leave after giving birth. In this period, the University may not
require them to work. However, up on their request, the Research Assistant
may return to work for duties approved by a doctor.
Eligibility
The Childbirth Accommodation Policy applies to registered OIST graduate
students, who are anticipating or experiencing a birth, adoption, or delivery by
surrogacy.
An Academic Accommodation Period can be granted to the father of the child or
partner of the mother in cases where graduate student couples share the care of
newborn children and the partner is the primary caregiver for the infant.
An Academic Accommodation Period can also be extended to the new parents after
adoption, fostering a child, or the birth of a biological child using a surrogate to
bring to term.
Planning for the Academic Accommodation Period
The student should initiate discussions with the academic mentor and the Dean of
the Graduate School at least four months prior to the anticipated birth in order to
make arrangements for an Academic Accommodation Period. These discussions
should establish a timeline for academic issues (e.g., class attendance, rotations,
examinations, thesis proposal, and other academic commitments) that will be
affected by the birth of a child and by the postponement of academic requirements.
It is essential that students undertaking thesis research consult with the thesis
supervisor well in advance of the birth. It is the student's responsibility to make
arrangements with faculty and with graduate school administrators for course
completion and for continuation of educational, research and professional
development activities before and after the Academic Accommodation Period.
One of the purposes of the Childbirth Accommodation Policy is to make it possible
for women to maintain their full-time student status. By remaining full-time
students, the visa status of international students is not affected. Careful
consultation should be undertaken to ensure that the implications for academic
progress, visa status, and financial support have been thoroughly investigated. In
completing the application for the Academic Accommodation Period, the student
may optionally request up to two terms of part-time enrolment. If part-time
enrolment status is approved, the student will retain all privileges of the Childbirth
Accommodation Policy. Independent of making this request for part-time
enrolment, if a serious medical problem were to arise for mother or newborn, the
woman student would be eligible for extension of the period of Childbirth
Accommodation Policy until the medical problem is resolved.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Residency requirements
The expectation is that the student will be in residence in Okinawa, and, assuming
good health of the pregnant woman or new mother and the infant, will remain
engaged in class work and research, even if at a reduced level.
Childbirth Accommodation Policy for students who are not in
residence
A student may choose to take leave from the Academic Program and not be in
residence for a period of time. In such a case a period of Non-study Leave may be
granted in accordance with the Non-study Leave regulations (ref PRP 5.3.17.3) up
to a maximum of two consecutive academic terms around the time of the birth.
The student may postpone course assignments, examinations, and other academic
requirements during the period of absence and extension of the period of study by
the period of absence. Registration as a graduate student with continued access to
OIST facilities and housing will continue during the Non-study Leave period.
Financial support will be in accordance with the provisions for Full-time
employees for prenatal leave and postpartum leave as detailed in the Maternity
Leave provisions <ref>.
Applying for an Academic Accommodation Period
Graduate students anticipating or experiencing the birth of a child may formally
apply for an Academic Accommodation Period of up to two consecutive academic
terms around the time of the birth. This Academic Accommodation Period is not a
leave of absence from University responsibilities.
The Childbirth Policy is administered by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate
School through an application process. In that application, the student specifies
the dates on which the Academic Accommodation Period begins and ends, with the
requirement that the maximum duration is two consecutive terms. A letter from
the student’s health-care provider stating the anticipated delivery date must
accompany the application. If the childbirth occurs prior to filing the application,
the accommodation period begins on the birth date.
The Office of the Dean of the Graduate School will notify the student, the student’s
academic mentor, and the relevant University administrative offices that the
Academic Accommodation Period has been approved, along with the dates for the
accommodation period.
During and After the Academic Accommodation Period
Funding
Once a student submits an application, the Office of the Dean of the Graduate
School will ensure that students whose applications have been approved will see no
change in their financial support as Research Assistants.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Students who are supported by fellowships external to OIST must adhere to the
rules of the granting agency with respect to absences from academic and research
work. If the granting agency requires suspension of fellowship benefits the student
will be eligible for substitute payment from OIST under the terms of a temporary
Research Assistant agreement.
Duration
The student, academic mentor, and thesis supervisor (if applicable) should
recognize that it might not be feasible to return to a regular research assistant
assignment immediately after the accommodation period. In that case,
arrangements should be made to assign limited on-site duties. These issues should
be negotiated sensitively with the student’s needs in mind. The student should
work with the academic mentor, thesis supervisor, and Dean of the Graduate
School to make arrangements for ongoing support beyond the accommodation
period if unable to return to normal duties immediately.
The maximum duration of the Academic Accommodation Period is two
consecutive academic terms. If need extends beyond this limit due to ongoing
issues associated with childbirth, different leave provisions may apply depending
on the nature of the issues. In such case the affected student should make the
situation known to the Dean of the Graduate School as early as possible so that
measures can be taken.
Coursework and Research Activities
Approval of an Academic Accommodation Period will include an automatic
extension of due dates for assignments and other class work and research-related
requirements. Faculty are expected to work with the student to make
arrangements for submitting work for completion of requirements when the
student returns.
Access to the Child Development Center
Students are strongly advised to register, at the earliest possible time, for the
waiting list of the Child Development Center for access to on-campus nursery care
and early childhood education.
Additional Comment
The Childbirth Accommodation Policy establishes minimum standards for
accommodation for a graduate student giving birth or acting as the primary
caregiver for a newborn or adoptive infant. It is expected that academic mentors,
faculty, and the graduate school administration will work with sensitivity and
imagination to provide more than this minimum, according to the particular
circumstances of the student. For example, women whose research involves
working with toxic chemicals or fieldwork may need some form of accommodation
during the entire pregnancy and during lactation. Taking care of an infant is timeconsuming and sleep-depriving, so advisors need to have realistic expectations

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

about rates of progress on research. For their part, new parents need to keep the
lines of communication with their advisors open, and demonstrate to their
advisors that they are academically engaged and making progress on coursework
and research, even if it is at a somewhat slower pace than prior to giving birth. In
other words, the Childbirth Accommodation Policy is intended to support—not
replace—the open communication and good will that should characterize the
relationship between student, mentor and thesis supervisor at the Graduate
University.

Student support
5.4.1.
Financial support for students
The mission of OIST is to create an international graduate university that is best in
the world. This requires attracting the best students in the world. Other leading
international universities at this level provide support for tuition costs and living
expenses. The OIST Graduate University offers financial support comparable to that
offered by other leading research universities.
5.4.1.1.
OIST Graduate University Research Assistantship and
Senior Research Assistantship (Assistantships)
OIST Graduate University Research Assistantships and Senior Research
Assistantship (hereafter, Assistantships) are awarded to students on fulltime study in the doctoral program at the OIST Graduate School. A
student in good standing who performs research or who assists others in
performing research and educational activities is registered as a Research
Assistant. A student in a thesis lab after the qualifying exam is registered
as a Senior Research Assistant.
During tenure of the Research Assistant and Senior Research Assistant,
the student must undertake full-time doctoral studies in Okinawa, unless
a special case for exemption from this requirement has been previously
approved by the Graduate School.
The maximum tenure of a Research Assistant is normally two years and
three years for a Senior Research Assistant. Students are expected to
complete the requirements for graduation within the five year period. In
case of early completion of requirements, Senior Research Assistant is
continued for four weeks after the date of degree conferral, to allow time
for completion of matters required for conclusion of the research project
(such as archiving of the research records).
Continued financial support for students in the doctoral program
depends on maintained performance in study and research, and is based
on the provision of satisfactory annual Progress Reports. Assistantships
will be discontinued in the event of unexcused absence, failure to
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

maintain adequate academic performance, unethical behavior, or other
reasons determined by the academic oversight process to be incompatible
with good standing.
Overseas tenure of a Research Assistant and a Senior Research Assistant
is not normally permitted. In exceptional circumstances, a period of
overseas tenure may be granted by the Graduate School, if it can be
shown that access to research guidance, facilities or opportunities
overseas is essential to the completion of the project.
Assistantships are subject to annual confirmation of the Budget status
and are paid in equal monthly installments. Standard remuneration of
the OIST Graduate University Assistantships is about 3.0 million yen per
year including the amount equivalent to tuition fee. However, if the
Research Assistant is awarded for tuition waiver, the amount equivalent
to tuition fee is not provided.
5.4.1.2.
External fellowships and awards
While the University maintains financial support system, students are
strongly encouraged to apply for external fellowships. In order to reward
success, remuneration provided by the university as an OIST Graduate
University Assistantships or Teaching Fellowship including the amount
equivalent to tuition fee may be used to supplement external fellowships,
up to a maximum of 3.6 million yen total. An OIST Graduate University
Assistantships or Teaching Fellowship may be held concurrently with
external scholarship on this basis. There is an obligation on the student
to report external fellowships to the Graduate School office.
5.4.1.2.1. Teaching Fellowship
The University may offer special appointment as a Teaching Fellow to
a student who had been recognized for academic and research
excellence by an external award (JSPS scholarship etc.) In such cases
payment is made on a fixed-hours basis. It is still necessary to record
the teaching activity and hours for the individual academic record.
Students applying for special appointment as a Teaching Fellow
should apply with the required documents through the online web
form.
Appointment of Teaching Fellows will be made by the Curriculum and
Examinations Committee.
Service as a teaching fellow is normally paid. This depends on the
availability of budget, and the nature of the activity. When payment
is possible it is made on an hourly basis for the contact hours and
preparation time. Paid preparation time, when necessary, is based on
a maximum of 4 hours preparation for 1 hour of contact time. Details
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

of the conditions of service are separately stipulated.
5.4.1.2.2. Tuition waiver
The University may offer full amount tuition waiver to those who are
recognized for their excellence in performance of research work by
external awards (JSPS scholar etc.). Students applying for tuition
waiver should apply with required documents through online web
form. Application review and decision making will be made by the
Curriculum and Examination Committee.
5.4.1.3.

Financial Support in Exceptional Circumstances

In general, PhD funding at OIST is only for the standard period of study
which is 5 years. A student who continues to make satisfactory academic
progress in the program should be on course to complete within 5 years,
and progress is reviewed each year to keep on this track. Faculty and
students should plan a program that can be concluded, including writeup of the thesis, prior to the end of the 5th year.
In exceptional circumstances events beyond the control of the student may
compel an extension of the 5 years. In such cases the duration of financial
support may be extended by the Graduate School, subject to the
availability of funds. In all cases, there must be a clear plan for
completion, supported by the Thesis Committee. The following
circumstances may be considered possible grounds for an extension:
1. Delays due to the vicissitudes of research.
Exceptionally, a student who is making satisfactory academic
progress may be unable to complete their thesis research project in
the timeframe due to research-related factors beyond their control.
On the recommendation of the Thesis Committee, and approval of
the Dean of the Graduate School (who may refer the matter to the
Curriculum and Examinations Committee) extension up to 3
additional school terms (started from the beginning of each term
using the terms defined in Article 17 of the University Rules) may be
possible.
2. Change in thesis research laboratory.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

This may occur because of the departure or incapacity of the
supervisor, or because of a change of supervisor that has been
approved by the graduate school. In such cases, subject to continued
satisfactory academic progress, the financial support may be
extended by the Dean of the Graduate School for the period
necessary to complete the course of study. Continuation is subject
to positive annual academic progress reviews.
3. Other extenuating circumstances.
Where there are other significant extenuating circumstances, the
Dean of the Graduate School may grant an extension of up to three
terms upon request with supporting documentation (e.g. a medical
certificate). The extension shall start from the beginning of each
term using the terms defined in Article 17 of the University Rules.
Students who become responsible for the care of a new born or
newly adopted child in the family may apply for an extension of the
financial support period that takes into account the provisions of the
Childbirth Accommodation Policy.
Applications for extension of financial support should be made in writing
to the Dean of the Graduate School by the end of the 4th year.

5.4.1.4.
Travel support for educational purposes
The University does not provide grants for home leave. However, the
University provides travel support for visiting an educational institution.
The amount of support will be based on the lowest quote obtained from
the University’s PTAs for a round trip economy flight to the student’s
destination, no per-diem and lodging allowance will be provided.
However, the hotel arrangement due to flight connections can be
considered as a part of this travel support. As long as there is no
hindrance to study and the Research Assistant work, it is possible to take
paid annual leave or other types of leave during the travel period. This
support is available once each year of study. For students who do not yet
have an approved thesis supervisor, the travel is approved by rotation
supervisor and the Dean of the Graduate School. When students do have
an approved thesis supervisor, the thesis supervisor and the Dean of the
Graduate School approve the travel. For details concerning visiting an
educational institution, please refer to the OIST Guidelines for Student
Travel.

5.5.2.1
Special Research Students <Tokubetsu-Kenkyu-Gakusei>
Students of other universities (referred to as the “partner institution”)
who are permitted by the partner institution to receive research guidance
at the OIST Graduate University under the terms of an agreement with
the partner institution, may apply to become Special Research Students
at OIST. Special Research Students are not OIST PhD degree candidates
and there is no mechanism to change the status of a Special Research
Student to become an OIST PhD student except by application to the
OIST graduate program in the usual way.
Candidates for Special Research Student status must obtain approval
from the Dean of the OIST Graduate School and Dean of Research of the
OIST Graduate University. The Dean of the Graduate School will make a
recommendation to the Dean of Research after consultation with the
OIST research supervisor and partner institution. In general, such
applications will be approved provided this poses no obstacles to the
education and research activity of the Graduate School.
Faculty members of the OIST Graduate School can provide supervision
to Special Research Students of the partner institution under the terms
of an agreement with the partner institution. The period for which a
student can receive research guidance as a Special Research Student
must be stipulated in the agreement. This term is normally for one year,
subject to renewal as needed. Upon the completion of the period of
supervision at OIST, or annually, the OIST supervisor is required to
submit a written report on the student to the Dean of the OIST Graduate
School.
Special Research Students can take OIST courses as Course Auditors (see
5.5.2.5.) or receive credits at their home University for completion of
courses at OIST as Visiting Students (see 5.5.2.4.).
Special Research Students must observe OIST Graduate University rules
as defined in the Graduate School Handbook and the OIST Graduate
University PRP. Rules concerning Intellectual Property are separately
stipulated in Chapter 14. Special Research Students who violate the rules
of the OIST Graduate University may be disqualified and have their
research guidance terminated.
Special Research Students enjoy many of the same privileges of students
for full-time study in the doctoral program in the University, with the
exception of Financial Support, which is handled differently.
5.5.2.1.1.

Students of newly-hired faculty

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Students of newly hired faculty who relocate to OIST before
completion of their PhD degree may need special arrangements
to facilitate the successful completion of their PhD. If the student
is able to complete their research at OIST while continuing to be
enrolled at their original home institution, they can be received
as Special Research Students receiving research guidance from
the relocating faculty member. Such students would graduate
with a degree from the home institution.
Students who desire to transfer their degree studies to the OIST
Graduate University and graduate with the OIST degree must
apply for admission as full-time graduate students. These
candidates follow standard OIST admission procedures and
selection is on a competitive basis with other applicants. Selected
candidates are admitted to the OIST program and follow the OIST
curriculum, according to the program outlined in Chapter 5.
5.5.2.1.2.
Procedures for Special Research Students
Special Research Students must be formally accepted and
registered as Special Students at the OIST Graduate University in
accordance with Article 43 of the University Rules. The Graduate
School must be notified of the intention to host the student by the
Professor of the Research Unit in a timely manner (at least
6months prior to the expected start date). The procedure for
acceptance and registration requires the student to submit the
documents listed below:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)
vi)

Application for admission as a Special Research
Student (using the appropriate Form)
Recommendation letter from thesis supervisor in the
partner institution
Brief outline of arrangements and plan of research at
OIST from the OIST supervisor
Copy of transcript of the current degree at the home
institution
Brief Curriculum Vitae of the applicant
Digital image of student’s photograph (on a white
background) and a scan of the information page of the
passport if a visa is required

In general, a written agreement with the partner institution is
required to confirm the understanding of the arrangements and
agreement of the partner institution. It is important that the
degree requirements of the partner institution can be met at
OIST. The Graduate School will complete such an agreement
with the partner institution. Such an agreement may allow for
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

mutual waiver of tuition fees. Where such an agreement does not
exist, tuition fees may be charged to the student.
After acceptance of the student, the Graduate School will make a
recommendation to the Research Unit concerning the conditions
of financial support for the Special Research Student. The
student must declare any external financial support from the
partner institution or external funding agency and this will be
taken into account in determining the recommended level of
financial support and benefits at OIST.
If a Special Research Students is elected by OIST as a Graduate
Student Research Assistant, the level of financial support and
conditions of appointment are stipulated in the SRS Research
Assistantship Agreement prepared by the Student Support
Section. If the Special Research Student is not receiving this
financial support, the conditions of appointment will be
stipulated in an offer letter that will constitute the agreement
between OIST and the Special Research Student after it is signed
by both parties.
The host Research Unit is responsible for making travel and
housing arrangements for the Special Research Student. As
necessary, the Student Support Section will assist with visa
processing requirements. Housing is available to Special
Research Students at student rates (see above, section
5.5.2.1.3.6.).

5.5.2.1.3. Financial Support for Special Research Students
No financial support is available from the Graduate School or
other central fund at OIST. In some circumstances, financial
support for Special Research Students may be available from the
host research unit, in which case financial support for Special
Research Students, including salary SRS Research Assistantship
and other benefits, should be included in the budget of the host
research unit. Students seeking such support must organize this
with the Professor of the host research unit in advance.
The following benefits may be available to Special Research
Students on the advice of the Graduate School with approval of

5.5.2.2.
Research Interns
Previously registered, current, or intending students of another
university who wish to undertake educational activity at OIST may do so
as Research Interns. Research Intern placements give talented students
experience working in a research setting under the direction of a
Professor at OIST.
The Graduate School administers a limited number of Research Intern
positions as part of its student recruitment and outreach program.
Research Interns may also be supported by Research Units with
approval of the Dean of the Graduate School, provided this poses no
obstacles to the education and research activities of the Graduate
School. Places for Research Interns are awarded four times a year on a
competitive basis, with application typically six months in advance.

5.5.2.2.1.
Eligibility
Students enrolled at undergraduate programs in universities,
colleges, junior colleges, and vocational schools in Japan or
overseas, or graduates of such institutions who intend to
undertake further study are eligible to apply.
Applications from students who are already in PhD programs at
other universities will also be considered, but undergraduate
students will receive preference for funding from the Graduate
School.
The applications of high ranking applicants who are already in
PhD programs will be forwarded to the Faculty for consideration
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

of placement in research units, supported by research unit funds.
Applications from currently enrolled students must be supported
by a recommendation letter from the Dean, Head of Department,
or supervising professor of the program they are enrolled in.
5.5.2.2.2.
Application
Places for Research Interns are awarded four times a year on a
competitive basis. Application must be made using the online
application form in accordance with the procedures and
deadlines that are posted on the OIST website. Sufficient time
must be allowed for the issue of a visa and other necessary
Japanese government documentation.
Selection is competitive, and depends on suitability of the
intended research, a student's academic background, and
available funding and space. Professors accepting students under
these programs will review the student’s qualifications, research
capabilities, and academic training in a comprehensive manner.
5.5.2.2.3
Duration
The tenure of Research Intern placement is normally less than 6
months. Under no circumstances may tenure be extended more
than 1 year. Under some circumstances with approval of the Dean
of the Graduate School, students may stay longer than 1 year as

University Holidays. The working hours are from 9:00am to
5:30pm.
5.5.2.2.5
Financial Support
OIST expects that such Research Interns are independently
funded but provides a small internship allowance, commuting
support (where necessary), and accommodation either on
campus or nearby. Successful applicants will receive a taxable
Internship Allowance of ￥2,400 per work day, while at
OIST. No internship allowance will be paid for University
Holidays, or for working days on which Research Interns work
less than four hours. In addition, where necessary, OIST will also
provide up to a maximum of ￥45,000 per month as a

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Commuting Allowance and up to a maximum of ￥3,500 per day
as Overnight Accommodation Costs (instead of provision of
accommodation costs, accommodation is normally provided at
no cost to the student). The Internship Allowance will be adjusted
if the Research Intern has another source of financial support.
There is an obligation on the Research Intern to report other
sources of financial support to the Student Support Section
before their arrival. The amount of other support will be taken
into account in determining the level of the financial support
provided by OIST.
5.5.2.2.6
Leave
Research Interns may take unpaid leave during the internship
provided: the total leave days number less than 10% of the total
duration of the work days of the internship; the leave is approved
by their supervisor; the Student Support Section is informed by
submitting a leave request through the website [link]; there is no
hindrance to their research activities.
5.5.2.2.7
Travel
OIST will pay for one direct round-trip travel for Research
Interns between the home university or institution and the
Research Unit or other facility where the internship will take
place (usually Okinawa). The travel dates must be as close as
possible to the term of the placement. On departure from OIST,
overseas students may additionally stop over for up to 5 days
(excluding weekends and Japanese holidays) as they transit
through an international hub airport in Japan, at the rate of one
day per week of tenure at OIST, provided that this poses no
additional cost in terms of flights, and that they do so entirely at
their own expense.
5.5.2.2.8 Other Support
The Student Support Section of the Graduate School will provide
support for Research Interns at OIST with matters such as
housing, visa acquisition, insurance during their research
activities, and local registration. OIST regrets that support for

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Visiting Students are registered students of another university who wish
to take one or more courses offered by the OIST Graduate School for
credit at their home university. With the prior permission of the Dean,
who will take into account such factors as class size, such a student may
enroll as a Visiting Student. Applications for admission as a Visiting
Student must be received one month before the start of the course,
using the appropriate form (see Forms). Credit cannot be awarded to
course auditors who are not formally enrolled as Visiting Students.
Registered graduate or undergraduate students of another university
who seek credit for attending OIST International Workshops and

Improvement of education
5.6.1.
Basic Policy of Faculty Development
The Graduate University must maintain and improve the quality of its Faculty in
order to provide an outstanding education at OIST and to meet the different
educational needs of each student. The Graduate School will play an active role in

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

the development of faculty members by implementing programs for faculty
development in teaching and supervision of graduate students.
5.6.2. Methods
Specifically, the Graduate University will conduct the following:
5.6.2.1.
Teaching Guidelines
The Faculty Development section of the Office of the Dean of the
Graduate School will create, maintain and distribute guidelines for
quality teaching to ensure uniform best-practice teaching standards are
observed at OIST.
5.6.2.2.
Student Teaching Evaluations
Students will evaluate each course at the end of the course. The results of
such evaluations will be distributed to the teacher, and will also be
available to students. The student responses to a standard subset of
questions will be reported to the Office of the Dean of the Graduate
School. The Faculty Development section of the Office of the Dean of the
Graduate School will assist the teacher to respond appropriately to this
feedback.
5.6.2.3.
Peer Review of Teaching
Faculty members will support the development of their colleagues by
participating from time to time as classroom observers, with the

Academic progression requirements

The OIST Graduate University is committed to early identification and support of
students who are not meeting academic progression requirements, and to
maintaining academic standards of students in the PhD program.
5.9.1.1 Identification of unsatisfactory academic progress
The Curriculum and Examination Committee annually reviews the
academic records of all students. Students who show signs of not meeting
academic progression requirements are identified by review of course and
rotation evaluations, conducted by the Dean of the Graduate School at the
end of each term, or by the PhD Thesis Committees on the basis of annual
progress reports. The Dean of the Graduate School notifies the Committee
of any students who are failing to meet academic progression
requirements. Students who are not meeting progression requirements
are alerted by the Dean of the Graduate School and provided assistance
to address issues affecting progress.
Satisfactory academic progression requires:
1. A level of performance in courses and rotations meeting all of the
following criteria:
i.

Completing an approved program of elective coursework with
at least a “Pass” evaluation in all courses, at a rate sufficient

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

to meet the cumulative credit requirements for progression
to thesis research and graduation;
ii.

Completing all compulsory coursework with at least a “Pass”
evaluation;

iii.

Completing all required rotations with at least a “Pass”
evaluation;

iv.

Achieving overall satisfactory progress as determined in
annual evaluation by the Curriculum and Examinations
Committee. The Curriculum and Examinations Committee
may require a minimal evaluation higher than a “Pass” in the
overall academic performance of the student.

2. Satisfactory progress in research defined by the following criteria:
i.

Timely development by the student of research goals that can
be realized at the OIST Graduate University.

ii.

Submission of a Thesis Proposal within nine months of
commencing Preliminary Thesis Research.

iii.

Passing the qualifying examination for advancement to
candidacy within twelve months of commencing Preliminary
Thesis Research.

iv.
v.

Satisfactory Annual Progress Reports
Completion of the PhD thesis within five years of commencing
the program

Unsatisfactory academic progress is defined as failure to meet any of the
criteria listed above, as determined by the Curriculum and Examinations
Committee.
In the case of established unsatisfactory academic progress the
Committee may recommend probation or termination of candidacy.
Probation is an option if satisfactory progress can be achieved by (a)
repeating and passing a failed unit (course or rotation); or, (b)
substituting and passing an approved alternative unit. If the Committee

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

recommends probation the Dean of the Graduate School alerts the
student and explains the conditions the student must meet for
satisfactory academic progress.
Discontinuation is applied if a student fails a repeated or substituted
course or rotation, or fails to make satisfactory progress in research.
5.9.2.

Discontinuation of studies
Discontinuation for unsatisfactory academic progress
Students in the PhD program may be discontinued for unsatisfactory
academic progress. In such cases the Dean of the Graduate School may
order the discontinuation of that student upon obtaining permission
from the President, and with endorsement of the decision by the
Curriculum and Examinations Committee.

5.10. Committees of the Graduate School
5.10.1. Admissions Committee
The Admissions Committee is a standing committee of the University with delegated
authority from the Faculty Assembly to select students for admission to the PhD
program, and is advisory to the Dean of the Graduate School. The main purpose of
the Admissions Committee is to deliberate and advise on matters related to graduate

5.12 Respectful Workplace and Anti-Harassment Policies
The University is committed to creating and maintaining a safe and respectful environment in
which all officers, employees, students, and visitors are treated with dignity and respect, in
accordance with the Respectful Workplace Policy. The Respectful Workplace Policy is a core
value of the University and the University will not tolerate disrespectful communication,
discrimination, harassment, or bullying, in any form.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.12.1.1 The University takes all harassment claims seriously and
handles them in confidence. For allegations relating to violations of
Respectful Workplace and Anti-Harassment policies, the University has
a process for students. When a violation of the Respectful Workplace
Policy or an act of harassment is reported, the University takes remedial
measures and appropriate corrective actions.
5.12.1.2 If a student experiences or witnesses a violation of the
Respectful Workplace Policy, or sexual, power, or other harassment, the
student should consider taking action to inform the University of the
situation by any of the following procedures.
5.12.1.3 To report such disputes or incidents of harassment, students
should contact either the confidential external Respectful Workplace
and Anti-Harassment hotline (RWAH hotline), designated contact staff
in the Graduate School, or the Dean of the Graduate School (DGS).
5.12.1.4 For students who need advice and counseling, the Ganjuu
Wellbeing Service is available to all OIST community members. The
Ganjuu Wellbeing Service offers consultation, advice, and intervention
in relation to a range of problems including harassment and other
behaviors inconsistent with the OIST Respectful Workplace Policy.
5.12.1.5 Protection from Retaliation
The University will not tolerate retaliatory action against any student for
making a good faith report of incidents of harassment based on the
procedures in this chapter. Similarly, the University will not tolerate any
direct or indirect use (or attempted use) of official authority or official
influence for the purpose of interfering with the rights of a student
making a protected disclosure.
5.12.2 Rules
All students of the University are eligible to seek both informal and formal resolution
of violations of Respectful Workplace and Anti-Harassment Policies using the
procedures set out in this Chapter.
A student who wishes to make a claim of harassment or violation of the Respectful
Workplace Policy may seek informal resolution by consulting with the designated
contact staff in the Graduate School (Manager of the Student Support Section,
Manager of the Academic Services Section, or Manager of the Admissions and Career
Development Section) or contacting the confidential external RWAH hotline.
Alternatively, the student may seek a formal harassment resolution process by
submitting a written claim of harassment or violation of the Respectful Workplace
Policy to the Graduate School.

ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

5.12.2.1 Consulting designated contact staff in the Graduate
school
A student (claimant) may consult with one of the designated contact staff
in the Graduate School for an explanation of the process and for
confidential support and advice.
Contact staff must arrange a meeting with the claimant within three
working days of the request, or within one working day if the request is
marked urgent. The meeting with the Graduate School contact staff must
be logged by the designated contact staff. After understanding the
situation, the designated contact staff will outline, or implement, some of
the possible choices from among the following alternatives:
5.12.2.1.1 Monitoring and Review for Informal
Resolution
The claimant may decide to register a claim with the Graduate
School and seek an informal resolution. The designated contact
staff is required to log the claim and then monitor and review.
Informal resolution may involve consulting with, for example, the
Academic Mentor, Thesis Supervisor, Thesis Committee, Chair of
Faculty Assembly, the Dean of Research, or the Dean of Faculty
Affairs. In all cases the Graduate School will check back with the
claimant to see if the issue is resolving satisfactorily. If it is not
resolving satisfactorily, other options such as proceeding to a
formal claim process will be suggested. Formal options may also
be suggested in the first instance if appropriate.
5.12.2.2 Contacting the External Hotline
At any point in the process (including before deciding whether to file a
claim with the Graduate School), every student is entitled to use the
external RWAH hotline to consult with OIST-designated outside
independent mediators.
5.12.2.3 Filing a Claim with the Graduate School for Formal
Resolution
A student may seek a formal resolution by filing a written claim to the
Graduate School. A student making a claim (claimant) may initiate a
formal resolution process as a first option, or be advised to take this
option by RWAH hotline. The designated contact staff in the Graduate
School can assist in preparing the written statement; however, the
document must be based on the claimant’s statement.
5.12.2.3.1 The DGS must review the written statement, in
consultation with the claimant, and determine the next steps
according to the Policy and Rules. If the matters in the claim are
matters that come under the Respectful Workplace Policy or Antich05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

Harassment and Anti Bullying Policy, the DGS initiates the next
steps in this chapter. The claimant is consulted before any steps
are taken, unless the Graduate School has a duty of care to take
this further. This may happen, for example, if a criminal offense is
alleged to have occurred. If the complaint concerns criminal
behavior, any criminal investigation will take precedence over an
OIST investigation or resolution processes. However, the
Graduate School and Ganjuu Wellbeing Service can still be
approached for support and advice.
5.12.2.3.2 Resolution by the Graduate School
Harassment Investigative Committee
The DGS will establish and convene a Graduate School
Harassment Investigative Committee (GSHIC) within 15 working
days after receiving the written claim.
The GSHIC consists of 3 members, one of whom is designated as
the chair by the DGS. In addition, a legal counsel appointed by the
General Counsel joins the committee as an observer. A Graduate
School staff member provides secretarial support.
The GSHIC conducts an impartial and confidential
investigation/review to determine the facts and circumstances of
the case, and make recommendations to resolve the matter. In
principle, the GSHIC should prepare a written response to the
DGS within 20 working days from the date the GSHIC first
convenes. If additional time is needed, the DGS must be
informed of the expected date of response.
A written response to the claim must be given to the claimant by
the DGS within 10 working days from the date the GSHIC report
is received by the DGS unless additional time is needed, in which
case the claimant must be informed of the expected date of
response. In some cases, the claimant may only be notified that
the matter has been closed, without receiving any details of the
outcome.
5.12.2.3.3 Executive Committee Level Harassment
Dispute Resolution
A problem that has not been resolved at the GSHIC level may be
brought to a Harassment Dispute Resolution Committee (HRC).
The request must be submitted, in writing, by the claimant to the
DGS. For details about HRC, see PRP 39.6.2.4.
5.12.2.4 Ganjuu Wellbeing Service and Student Peer
Supporters
ch05_graduate-school-handbook_en_20181221_cl

At any point in the process (including before deciding whether to
contact the Graduate School) a student can contact the Ganjuu
Wellbeing Service or the Student Peer Supporters for confidential
support and advice.
5.12.2.5 Exclusions
Appeals related to academic matters such as grading or outcomes
of examinations are handled separately by an appeals process e.g
PRP 5.3.11.7. Cases where the main issue is academic, scientific,
or research misconduct or non-compliance the DGS will refer the
matter to the internal contact points stipulated in PRP 23.4.1.1.
If the matter involves a non-academic employee the matter will be
referred to the Vice President for Gender Equality and Human
Resource Development (VPGEHR) and follow the procedures in
PRP 39.6.2.3.
In the case of allegations made against the President, regardless of
the nature of the allegations, the DGS will report directly to the
Chair of the Board of Governors of the University. In the case of
allegations made against a Member of the Executive including
Deans, regardless of the nature of the allegations, the DGS will
report directly to the President. In the case of allegations made
against the DGS the matter will be referred to the VPGEHR and
follow the procedures in PRP 39.6.2.3.
5.12.3 Responsibilities
5.12.3.1 Students
Students must attempt to solve disputes in accordance with the
procedures provided in this chapter.
5.12.3.2 Dean of the Graduate School
The DGS must inform students about the availability of the RWAH
hotline mediators and the formal and informal procedures in this
chapter. The DGS is responsible for performing the tasks and
duties outlined in this chapter.
5.12.3.3 Contact staff in the Graduate School

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules, & Procedures
Authority: Approved by the Dean of the Faculty Affairs

Chapter 6. University Library
6.1

Policy Statement

Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University Library (“the
Library”) is a key part of the University infrastructure, critical to the education
and research activities of the University. The Library provides both a central
library facility and an online environment for University-affiliated users to have
access to a diverse range of literature, reference materials and databases. By
providing access to electronic form of research, scholarship, and creative works
of the University (hereafter collectively referred to as “the Works”), the Library
contributes to development of education and research activities as well as
promoting information disclosure and establishing accountability to the society.
6.2

General Considerations
6.2.1 The Library Collection
The Library holds a collection of electronic and printed materials (the
Collection) to support the teaching and research activities of the
University. The Collection includes sufficient printed materials to
support teaching and general reference needs on campus, and also
contains a large amount of electronic material to allow users to access a
wide range of sources that cannot be provided as printed material
because of cost and limitations on space. In addition, the electronic
material is accessible to users remotely both on and off campus.
6.2.1.1 Books
A limited collection of printed books is maintained in the library on
campus. This includes textbooks used in courses taught at the
University, important research reference books, and selected books
of general interest. The main focus is on science and technology,
but the Library also holds material to assist in the daily life of the
University staff and students. The Library maintains a catalog and
book ID system that tracks each book owned by the Library. This
reduces duplication and enhances the range of books available to all
users.
6.2.1.2 Journals
The Library strives to allow reasonable access to the widest available
range of journals to support the academic activity at the University.
When new areas of interest arise, effort is made to subscribe to
additional relevant journals. The Library will review annually the list
of journals under subscription and make additions and deletions,
taking into account the changing needs of the University community
and the available budget. Print copies of the most high-demand
journals are also kept on display, for up to 6 months or until space is
1
Ch06_UniversityLlibrary_20170816_en_cl

no longer available. Older copies of these print journals are kept in
storage until disposed of.
6.2.1.3 eBooks
Books with a limited lifespan that are rapidly updated, are better
provided as electronic books rather than printed books. These
include intrinsically transient publications like manuals for specific
software and programming handbooks, methods manuals, and
technical guides. In addition, electronic versions of books are
provided when use is infrequent where they are only available
electronically. eBooks and print books are treated alike by the
catalog and can be accessed from inside the University network.
6.2.1.4 Databases
The Library provides access to a range of databases to support the
research and educational activities of the University and the
Graduate School. The Library provides training in searching and
using these databases.
6.2.1.5 Reserve Collection
Courses or other University activities may ask that some books,
journal articles, or other materials temporarily be set aside for
restricted use in a reserve collection. (ex: Course Reserve Books [link:
6.3.2.1.3]）
6.2.1.6 Closed Reserve Collection
In special cases of rare or valuable references or materials, the
Library may establish closed reserve collections that require special
approval from the Librarian for access.
6.2.2 The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology
Graduate University Institutional Repository
The Library provides open access to the Works of the University
personnel and/or students through the Okinawa Institute of Science and
Technology Graduate University Institutional Repository (hereinafter
referred to as “OISTIR”). The details of OISTIR is defined in “Okinawa
Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University Institutional
Repository Operational Guidelines”.
6.2.3 Layout of the Library
The Library provides a range of areas and rooms for different uses. This
includes desks for studying, computers to access the library catalog and
electronic collection, comfortable chairs for reading, copying, and
facilities for user-operated check-out of books.
6.2.4 Interlibrary Collaboration and Cooperation
The Library maintains membership in associations and consortia of
university, research, and public libraries across Japan to support the
activities of the Library. These agreements allow University faculty, staff
and students access to a wider range of material than can be held within
the University Collection. As a corollary, the University then allows other
universities and consortia members access to the holdings of the
University, as long as these are in agreement with the conditions imposed
2
Ch06_UniversityLlibrary_20170816_en_cl

by publishers and suppliers of those materials to the University.
6.2.5 Copyright Management
The Library manages the University’s obligations under the various
national copyright conventions, including the copying and storage of
journal articles, books, and database materials.
6.2.6 Access
The Library is a limited public access library and will provide storage for a
defined range of materials pertaining to the operation of the University
and for the University records of public interest, and will provide
reasonable access to those materials.

Policies, Rules and Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 7. Fundraising
7.1 Policy
Throughout history, private support for universities has been essential to their growth
and academic excellence. Even today, contributions and donations to colleges and
universities from individuals, the private sector, nonprofit foundations, and other
entities are critical to strengthening their physical and intellectual foundations. Such
support augments existing education and research programs and is indispensable for
new ventures in science and technology and for other advancement. Recognizing this,
gifts to, and fundraising for, the University is encouraged.
Fundraising at the University involves solicitation of contributions, donations, and gifts
as well as bequests, and devises, together referred to as “gifts” [link: 7.8]. Fundraising
also may proceed through University events (ticket sales) and sales of items bearing
University marks and logo.
All fundraising activity at the University must be supervised, coordinated, and directed
by and through the Fundraising office in the Office of the President [link: 2.4.1]. It is
the Fundraising office that, in consultation with the President , prioritizes fundraising
initiatives to meet the University’s objectives. These priorities are the main focus of the
Fundraising office’s efforts.
The President will maintain a prioritized list of donors who are approved for solicitation.
All solicitations and negotiations regarding gifts require the express prior approval of
the President.
Gifts in support of research are reviewed in coordination with the office of the President
to assure appropriate disposition and treatment.
7.2 General Considerations
7.2.1 Often donors are interested in whether a tax deduction is available for a gift
to the University. To ensure that a tax deduction is available, Gifts to the
University from United States’ donors are to be made through the Friends of
OIST Foundation and gifts to the University from Japanese donors must be made
through the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private School of Japan
[Nihon Shiritsu Gakkou Shinkou Kyousai Jigyoudan].

1
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

7.2.2 Restricted Gifts, those made for a defined purpose or for an area of research
specified by the donor, deserve special attention and often involve negotiation
7.2.2.1 A restricted gift involving a designated area or aspect of research is
subject to the same research review process as research grants.(Chapter
4.8[link: 4.8])
7.2.3 Gifts that involve associated costs for the University to pay (e.g., the donor
pays building construction costs but the University must pay for building
maintenance and repairs) are acceptable but require close review.
7.2.4 Gifts vs Grants. A grant, which may be provided by governments, the
private sector, or a private individual donor, is not a “gift” because the grantor
effectively determines how the money is to be used, requires audits of expenditure,
places time and other constraints on the research, requires periodic reports, and
may obtain a commercial interest in the results of the research, among other things.
Additionally, grants (including private grants made by individuals) may be
subject to an indirect costs (overhead) assessment, whereas gifts will not be
subject to that imposition. Grants should be administered by the Grants and
Research Collaborations Section (in the office of the Dean of Research ) rather
than the Fundraising office. Thus it is very important to distinguish between a
gift and a grant.
7.2.4.1 Gifts. In general, donated funds are gifts when the following
characteristics exist:
- the donor intends to make a charitable contribution;
- the donor does not impose contractual requirements; and
- the funds are given irrevocably.
7.2.4.2 Private grants. In general, provision of funds are grants when any
of the following characteristics exist:
- there is provision for audits by or on behalf of the person providing
the money;
- the person providing the money is entitled to receive some
consideration such as a detailed technical report of research results
or a report of expenditures;
- the research is directed to satisfying specific requirements as
directed by the person providing the money (e.g., a precisely stated
scope of work to be accomplished within a specific period of time,
instead of a statement supporting a general area of research);
- a specified period for performance is prescribed, or termination is
at the discretion of the person providing the money;

2
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

-

funds that are unexpended at end of period are to be returned to
the person providing the money;
- patent or licensing rights are requested by the person providing the
money.
7.2.5 Gifts involving “matching funds” are permissible.
7.2.5.1 Care must be exercised to determine whether such a gift might
actually constitute a joint research collaboration, which should be referred
to the office of the President.
7.2.6 “In Kind” donations (items rather than money) to support a research
collaboration are subject to different rules and should be referred to the office of
the President for review.
7.2.7 Special attention must be paid to the nature of the agreement when a gift is
given by a commercial company. No direct profit-based advantage to a
commercial entity can be part of an agreement between the University and the
commercial enterprise making a gift.
7.3 Rules
7.3.1 All fund-raising activity at the University must be supervised, coordinated,
and directed by and through the Fundraising office [link: 2.4.1].
7.3.1.1 The President maintains a prioritized list of donors who are
approved for solicitation and this list must be consulted each time
fundraising occurs.
7.3.1.2 No solicitation or negotiation regarding a gift can be made
without the President’s explicit approval.
7.3.1.3 Gifts supporting specified research or specified aspects of
research must be reviewed in collaboration with the office of the
President.
7.3.2 No direct profit-based advantage, implied commercial return or other
benefit may result in favor of a commercial entity seeking to donate funds or
other gifts to the University. (Chapter 22.2) [link: 22.2]
7.3.2.1 Donations of specialized/unique research or other equipment
which may require servicing and maintenance by the donor’s
commercial enterprise require justification prior to acceptance.

3
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

7.3.3 Gifts which may involve donor use of the University names and marks
must be coordinated with the office of the Vice President for Public Relations
& Communication. (Chapter 16 [link: 16])
7.3.4 Fundraising proposals must satisfy the following criteria:
7.3.4.1 The funds raised will support a key mission or objective of the
University;
7.3.4.2 The fundraising arrangement will not breach any other contract held
by the University;
7.3.4.3 There is a connection between the University and the recipient of
any solicitations;
7.3.4.4 Recipients of the invitations or solicitations have not been the
subject of recent or repeated solicitations from the University; and
7.3.4.5 The number of similar promotional events over the last 12 months
has not been so excessive as to give the University an appearance of undue
commercialism.
7.3.5 Fundraising proposals based on sales of items to the public and use of the
University’s name, marks, or logos [link: 15] must demonstrate the following:
7.3.5.1 The commercial entity selected to provide the items has a very
high reputation for quality and service in its industry;
7.3.5.2 The commercial entity selected to provide the items to be sold
has values and operational practices that are consistent with the
University’s;
7.3.5.3 The product to be offered is of high quality; and
7.3.5.4 The price proposed by the entity selected to provide the items is
competitive within the relevant market.
7.3.6 All gifts to support research, whether ultimately characterized as a gift to
advance education or research, or as a private grant [link: 7.2.4], is subject to the
research review requirements established by the office of the President.
7.3.7 All fundraising is subject to the policies, rules, and procedures that apply
to all University Funds.

4
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

7.3.8 An acknowledgment of the offer of a gift must be promptly sent to the
donor, indicating that the gift offer has been received in the Fundraising office
and the date of that receipt. An acknowledgement of receipt of a gift offer is not
the same as an acceptance of that gift.
7.3.9 Once a gift has been formally accepted by the University, an acceptance
letter must be promptly sent to the donor indicating the date of acceptance (not
necessarily the same as the date of receipt or the date of the acknowledgement).
Acceptance letters must state the nature of the gift and the amount (if cash) or a
description of the gift sufficient to link it to the donor.
7.3.9.1 Gifts that are conditional are not considered “accepted” unless
the University agrees to all the conditions and then notifies the donor of
acceptance of the gift and its conditions.
7.3.10 Announcement of gifts may only be made by the Office of The President
[link: 2.4.1].
7.3.11 Processing and official receipting of gifts are handled exclusively by the
Fundraising office, in coordination with the office of the Vice President for
Financial Management [link: 2.4.5.4].
7.3.12 Students should not be solicited for funds; their involvement in
fundraising activities is limited to providing time and effort (and enthusiasm)
only. Any exceptions to this constraint must be approved by the President [link:
2.4.1] and the Dean of the Graduate School [link: 2.4.5.1].
7.4 Responsibilities
7.4.1 The President must be involved in the process of reviewing gifts and gift
proposals in conformance with the requirements set out in 7.2 and 7.3 of this
Chapter.
7.4.2 The President should actively participate in raising funds from the private
sector by identifying and developing relationships with potential donors as
requested by the Fundraising office.
7.4.3 Faculty may assist in fundraising activities by identifying potential donors
to the Fundraising office. Faculty must request the assistance from and work
through the Fundraising office in the event they identify or come upon potential
donors/donations.
7.4.4 Individual faculty should refrain from negotiating with donors in the
absence of first identifying the donor to the Fundraising office. This avoids a)
5
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

the potential embarrassment of more than one faculty member pursuing a donor
simultaneously and b) solicitation in the absence of full knowledge and a sound
solicitation plan.

7.8.1 Bequest: The transfer of property (except real estate) under the terms of
a Last Will and Testament.
7.8.2. Contribution: A sum of money voluntarily provided in response to a
request or campaign seeking funds.
7.8.3. Deferred Gift: A gift divided into a present interest and a future interest,
6
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

usually by means of annuity, where the donor irrevocably gives one interest
(such as annuity payments to the University for a span of years starting at a
future date) but personally retains the remaining interest.
7.8.4 Designated Gifts (or Designated Funds): Gifts of money for a purpose
that is only loosely described by the donor. Typically, a designated gift merely
specifies a particular recipient, but the use of the money is not prescribed, e.g.,
JPY 3 m given as “shogakukifukin Fund (donation type)”, $5,000 donated for
use by the University Child Care Center, $500,000 donated to support the
Library, or $75,000 donated to the general endowment. The relevant decisionmakers and budget managers thus have some discretion to decide how
designated gifts are expended. Compare “restricted gifts”.
7.8.4.1 Shogakukifukin (donation type): a fund which is donated to
support education and research activities of the specific research unit
without requiring submission of a report on usage, etc. to the donor. See
“Instruction Regarding Shogakukifukin Fund (donation type)” [link:

7.8.7 Gift: A thing (or things, including money) voluntarily transferred by one
person to another person or to an entity, without remuneration by or any other
form of consideration from the person or entity to whom the transfer was made.
7.8.8 Grant
7.8.8.1 Research Grant
Money given to individuals (and sometimes to groups) to explore various fields
of study, most often in response to a proposal seeking funding for a specific area
of research. Grants cover the cost of research plus provide the researcher(s) with
income. Governments, private sector entities, and individuals all fund research
through grants. A grant is not a “gift” because the grantor effectively
determines how the money is to be used, requires audits of expenditure, places
time and other constraints on the research, and requires periodic reports, among
other things. Applicant should seek for an approval by the Dean of Research
through the Grants and Research Collaborations Section before applying for
research grant .
The Grants and Research Collaborations Section or the Business Development
Section will assist the applicant in financial report, activity report, audit and
7
ch07_fundraising_20170302_en_cl

other required activities by grantor. Overheads from research grant shall be as
stipulated in the PRP 27.5.3.
7.8.8.2 Non-Research Grant
Non-Research Grant is important external funds to promote the University’s
operation. Non-Research Grant is money given to individuals (and sometimes
to groups) to response to a proposal seeking funding for a specific
administrative work. Applicant should seek for an approval by the Vice
President of applicant’s division. Applicant should report the details of the
application and screening result to the Grants and Research Collaborations
Section at the earliest possible. Applying division shall conduct financial
reporting, activity reporting, audit and other required activities by grantor on
division’s responsibility. Overheads from non-research grant shall be as
stipulated in the PRP 27.5.3. However, in the case that rules for overheads is
not specified by grantor, all received amount can be used for the purposes of the
grant.
7.8.9 Restricted Gifts (or Restricted Funds): Donated money specifically
designated as to both purpose and recipient by the donor, e.g., $200,000 to fund
summer research student stipends in chemical engineering, $5,000 to purchase
a specific item for evolutionary biology research, or $50,000 to the office of the
Dean of the Graduate School to be used to recruit geology students who also
play the tuba. The relevant decision-makers and budget managers have very
little or no discretion regarding the use of restricted gifts. Compare “designated
gifts”.

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules and Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 10. Land, Buildings and Facilities
10.1

Policy

The land belonging to, and the buildings and facilities constructed at, OIST
Graduate University (the University) are resources intended to serve the various
purposes of the University.

The fundamental role of the Division of Buildings &

Facility Management at the University is to manage these resources to provide,
operate and maintain an environment that will enable all members of the
University community to carry out their work effectively in a safe and attractive
setting.

University policy is that the facilities and services provided must be sufficient,
efficient and reliable, but not extravagant. The University has an obligation to
utilize funding, whether from public or private sources, for construction,
operation, and maintenance in a sound and responsible manner, and it is
University policy always to endeavor to achieve the most cost-effective use of
funds available.

The University shall make all necessary and reasonable efforts to provide barrierfree access to University buildings and facilities for people with physical
disabilities.

This chapter addresses acquisition, use, security and upkeep of the campus
grounds, built facilities and major elements of plant and equipment (excluding
1
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

laboratory equipment) at the University.

Policies, rules and procedures for land

acquisition and procurement of construction are set out in Chapter 26, Finance
& Accounting and in Chapter 28, Procurement, while procedures relating to the
allocation of space and use of laboratory equipment are set out in Chapters 19,
University Events and 21, Use of University Resources.

10.1.1

Access to lab areas by outside parties

The basic policy for access to lab areas by outside parties is as follows.

1.

In principle, outside parties who are not directly engaged in
OIST research activities do not have access to the Lab buildings
or Administrative Office areas.

2.

Exceptions will be made to enable necessary construction and
equipment installation works and deliveries to be made in an
efficient manner-but in such a way that:
a.

there is minimal disturbance to lab users, and

b.

good operational security is maintained on the campus.

OIST

reserves

the

right

to

cancel

this

exceptional

authorization without notice nor explanation should the
condition above not being fulfilled.
3.

Exceptions will also be made when government agencies,
educational and research institutions, corporations, and media
visit lab buildings for campus tours guided by OIST employees
or students.

4.

Outside parties when permitted to enter inside OIST
acknowledge that they do so at their own risk.
a.

Accident in OIST properties is at their own risk.

2
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

b.

OIST will not bear any responsibilities for lost or stolen
personal belongings in OIST properties.

c.

If there is trouble or accident, ask OIST staff to call
Security Center immediately.

10.2

General Considerations

10.2.1

Adequate funding must be budgeted each year to ensure that

the infrastructure of the University campus is maintained in excellent
condition. This obligation includes forward planning to ensure that
sufficient funds are available when major overhaul or replacement of
elements of the infrastructure becomes necessary during the life of the
University. For this purpose, the term ‘infrastructure’ shall be
understood

to

include,

among

other

things,

the

campus

buildings(Chapter 10.8).

10.2.2

Most of the 213ha Onna campus is owned by and leased free-

of-charge from Onna Village, on an automatically renewing 10-year
lease first entered into in November 2011(Lease Agreement). Any
proposal to allow use of leased areas by a third party must be approved
by Onna Village in advance. The University also owns the 8.7ha site
known as the Seaside Campus, which comprises the Seaside House
building, eight units of faculty housing and an area of undeveloped land.

10.2.3

The University must use its financial resources for construction

in accordance with the obligations and conditions attached to the use of
those resources, if any. Most of the University’s budget is provided by
the Japanese government; therefore the University complies with
3
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

Japanese public works procurement policies for all nationally funded
construction and related works above defined values (Chapter 28).

At

the same time, the University aims to achieve the most rational and costeffective construction procurement possible, so every effort must be
made to minimize paperwork and inefficient procurement practices.

10.2.4

The University must minimize the impact of the campus

development and all activities taking place within it on the natural
environment. To this end, a comprehensive Environmental Impact
Assessment was carried out by an independent consultant prior to the
commencement of site development. This assessment identified several
species of flora and fauna on the site subject to protection, and set out
numerous conditions for the development of the site. Ongoing
environmental impact monitoring is conducted of construction
activities to ensure that the conditions stipulated in the EIA Report are
being observed. In addition, the University must satisfy prescribed
standards for air and water quality in all its activities, and in respect of
all waste emitted from the facilities (Chapter 13).

10.2.5

The Campus Village at the University has been developed

under a Public Private Partnership whereby a Special Purpose Company
(SPC) established by a commercial consortium has undertaken to build
the housing and related facilities on the campus and then operate them
on the University’s behalf for 30 years after completion. The details of
the contractual arrangement between the University and the SPC are set
out in the Project Contract. The relative roles and responsibilities of the
SPC and University with respect to the management, operation and
maintenance of the Campus Village are complex, and the Project
4
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

Contract should be referred to when any activity by the University that
impinges on the Campus Village is contemplated. The rules and
procedures related to utilization of the Village by University personnel
(including leasing procedures and conditions, tenant rights and
responsibilities, use of shared facilities, etc.) are currently under
development.

10.3

Rules

10.3.1

Budget Availability takes Precedence.

No commitment to carry out any construction or modification of the
facilities shall be made unless the funds necessary for the work are
available in the budget.

An exception may be granted by the President

if the construction is funded in installments by a private donor or entity.

10.3.2

Statutory Compliance.

Construction works and the installation of facilities at OIST, and the use
and maintenance of same, must comply with all relevant laws and
regulations in Japan. Some of these are set out in Table 10.1.

10.3.3

Access to University Buildings and Grounds.

Access must be provided as freely and unobtrusively as possible
consistent with security (Chapter 21.1). Priority of access is as follows:
First - faculty, students, other researchers, Senior Level Executives, and
staff; second – authorized vendors & contractors; third – OIST family
members and the general public.

5
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

10.3.3.1 Although the campus grounds are in principle open to
the general public, access to the Onna Campus buildings is
controlled at the points of entry to the buildings. Everyone
entering the campus buildings shall be required to comply with
the security procedures in force. In general, rules of access are as
follows:
-

Students shall be issued a security pass card upon
registration.

– Researchers (including scientific visitors, collaborators,
interns and invited guests), employees shall be issued with
a security pass card upon joining the University community,
which will give them access to differing areas of the
buildings depending on their need, and the training
required, for access.
– Guests, vendors, OIST family members and general visitors
shall be issued a different identifying pass card upon
signing in at the entrance reception.
The above rules will be waived only for special events such as
open days, at which times access to most areas of the buildings
will be strictly limited and controlled.

10.3.3.2 Vendor, etc. Access to Labs

1.

Contractors and equipment installation engineers doing
work in the buildings must register at the Security Office
by the Lab 1 loading dock, and will then be given an
armband and Security card with limited access.

6
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

2.

Vendors and others making sales calls or coming to
OIST for meetings, product seminars, etc. should make
an appointment, enter the campus at the Tunnel
Entrance (OIST gallery) on the ground level, register at
the security desk, and meet their OIST contact at the
meeting tables on Level A of the Center Buildings, on
Level C of Lab 2 just inside the Skywalk entrance, or in
the Cafeteria. Such visitors will not be issued with a
Security card and will not be permitted entry to the labs
unless specifically invited and hosted by a member of
faculty.

3.

In principle, lab supply deliveries should be picked up
from the Supply Center (Procurement) by unit staff, and
take acceptance inspection by supply center staff.
However, vendors making regular deliveries to labs may
continue to be given access to the Lab areas, provided
they do not undertake unsolicited sales activities.

4.

Mail and courier deliveries at Supply center, and will be
distributed to units by Supply Center (Procurement)
staff (printed materials only). However all packages,
boxes, etc. should be picked up from the Supply Center
by unit staff, and take acceptance inspection by supply
center staff.

NOTE: Safety Training
(1) Vendors, contractors, and other entering lab areas
on an occasional basis should read the OIST leaflet
“Safety Precautions in Lab Areas”
7
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

(2) Vendors

entering

lab

areas

regularly

shall

participate in a safety training session organized by
the Research Safety Section at least once a year.

10.3.4

Land Use Planning & Design

The overall development of the University’s Onna Campus has been
carried out in line with a Master Plan prepared in 2006 and approved
by the Board of Governors of the OIST Promotion Corporation. No
construction at the University shall be carried out without reference to
this Master Plan, and all proposals for construction, whether for a new
building or for modification of an existing facility (interior or exterior),
must be referred in advance to the Vice President for Buildings and
Facilities Management (VPBFM), who shall be responsible for
determining whether they are in accordance with the Master Plan.

10.3.4.1

Over time, the addition of facilities not envisaged in

the original campus master plan can be expected. In this case,
the Vice President for Buildings and Facilities Management
shall commission additional planning and/or design work to
ensure that such facilities are integrated into the overall
campus in a planned and consistent way (Chapter 10.4). Such
additional facilities must:
1) maintain the quality of the built environment at the
University, and
2) not compromise the potential for further
construction in future.

8
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

Final responsibility for determining whether the above criteria
are achieved in any such proposed expansion of the facilities is
vested in the Board of Governors.

10.3.5

Energy Conservation & Recycling.

Sophisticated laboratory buildings inevitably use a great deal of energy
to maintain precise environmental conditions within laboratory spaces
and to operate certain research equipment. However, considerable
effort has been made in the specification, design and construction of
University buildings to ensure that they are as energy efficient as
possible. While every University user has an obligation to utilize the
facilities in a responsible manner and conserve resources to the greatest
extent possible, the Division of Buildings & Facility Management is
primarily responsible for monitoring and managing energy, water and
other resource usage throughout the campus, and shall develop and
implement appropriate measures on a continuous improvement basis to
achieve optimal resource conservation.

10.3.5.1

Pursuant to the Article 7-2 of the “Act on the Rational

Use of Energy” (Act No.49 of 1979), an Energy Management
Supervisor is appointed to promote energy conservation at
OIST. VPBFM shall serve the position.

10.3.5.2 “Energy Management Regulation” is prescribed
separately for appropriate and effective implementation of the
rational use of energy at OIST.

9
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

10.3.5.3 The energy management supervisor establishes the
“Energy Management Committee”, which investigates and
discusses the energy management and energy saving at OIST
upon advice from the CEO/President. Details of the “Energy
Management Committee” are prescribed separately.

10.3.6

Historic and Archaeological Preservation.

Before construction commenced on the Onna Campus, a survey was
carried out to identify historic or archaeological artifacts on the site.
Reference must be made to this survey and its findings taken into
account when any new construction is proposed on the campus. In the
course of construction, if any such artifacts are uncovered, the
construction work in the area must be suspended, and notice given to
the Vice President for Buildings and Facilities Management, who must
then take immediate action to have such artifacts examined by a
competent authority, and determine the appropriate subsequent course
of action (Chapter 10.4).

10.3.7

Disaster Preparedness and Operational Continuity.

The Division of Buildings & Facility Management shall develop,
implement and maintain measures and procedures to ensure that the
safety of University users can be assured in the event of foreseeable
natural disasters such as typhoon, flood or earthquake, or incidents such
as fire, power failure or other potentially disruptive emergency on or off
campus. This role shall include ensuring that the operation and
activities of the university can be preserved and continued with minimal
10
ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

interruption after any such event. See also Chapter 13, Safety, Health,
and Environmental Protection.

This work shall include the preparation, in conjunction with other
Divisions, of a ‘red book’ setting out emergency contact and operational
procedures in the event of an incident; ensuring that standby power
systems and other resources (including stocks of emergency supplies)
are available and in good condition; and organizing appropriate training
of all University personnel in emergency procedures to ensure that the
safety and welfare of everyone can be maintained.

10.3.7.1

The University must establish clear procedures for

responding to an emergency situation(Chapter 13.3.17).

10.3.7.2

The University must provide emergency response

training to all employees and must inform visitors and guests

ch10_land-buildings-and-facilities_en_20181120_cl

10.3.7.4 The Disaster Recovery System shall be inspected and
maintained regularly, in accordance with the procedures set by
the Facilities Management Section.

10.3.8

Fire Prevention Planning

This plan, based on the Fire Prevention Act (Act No. 186 of 1948), Article
8, Paragraph 1, sets out the necessary fire prevention measures for the
University facilities located in Tancha, Onna Village designed to

Chapter 12. Document and Records Management
12.1. Policy
The OIST Graduate University (the University) is committed to achieving
efficient business operations and ensuring accountability to its stakeholders and
the general public by managing its documents and records in a systematic and
logical manner. All practices and procedures concerning document and record
management within the University, including their preparation, preservation,
disclosure, and disposal, are to be in accordance with this policy as well as the
related laws and regulations. This policy applies to all documents and records –
whether electronic or on paper and whether in English or Japanese – prepared
and acquired by University officers or employees, and held in the course of their
duties for the purpose of organizational use.
In addition, proper management of personal information is a particularly
important legal obligation in modern society, and it can be publicly damaging
and costly for an organization if it fails in that responsibility. As an institution
dealing with a variety of personal information such as information of students
(including applicants), alumni, employees, donors, event participants and etc.,
the University recognizes its social responsibility to use and protect such personal
information appropriately and to comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
12.2. General Considerations
12.2.1.
Legal Obligations
As a Japanese educational institution established with a special government
law and supported by Japanese tax-payers, the University is subject to the
laws listed below, which require a higher level of transparency and
accountability to the general public than is required of private universities.
The University is committed to meeting its responsibilities under these laws.
 Act on Management of Official Documents, etc. (Act No. 66 of
1
ch12_document-and-records-management_en_20180401_cl

2009) (Document Management Act)
 Act on Access to Information Held by Incorporated Administrative
Agencies (Act No.140 of 2001) (Information Access Act)
 Act on the Protection of Personal Information Held by
Incorporated Administrative Agencies (Act No. 59 of 2003)
(Personal Information Protection Act)
This chapter itself is subject to the legal disclosure requirement and will be
posted on the University’s external website.
12.2.2.
General Principles
All documents and records related to the business operations of the
University, regardless of their contents, must be treated with caution.
12.2.2.1.
In particular, when bringing out the documents and records
from the office for business trips or other reasonable purposes, the
documents should be treated with utmost care and attention. When
an employee uses a portable electronic devise to store documents and
records, he/she should make sure that no copies are left in the devise
after their use or when sharing such device with other individuals.
12.2.2.2.
When leaving a position at the University, employees must
transfer all documents and records that they store to their successor
or immediate supervisor.
12.2.3.
Electronic Documents and Records
The University is committed to introducing electronic systems in order to
conduct business transactions accurately and efficiently. In addition,
promotion of paper-less business operations helps the University meet its
environmental protection objectives. University officials and employees are
expected to prepare and store documents and records electronically whenever
it is possible. In principle, internal announcements and notices should be sent
via e-mails or posted on the internal portal.
Any electronic document and record, regardless of form, is regarded equally
important as paper-based documents under this policy. At the same time, it
will require greater attention to protect from the risks particularly associated
with electronic documents and records, such as falsification, leakage, and
deletion (Refer to 12.3.6.3, 12.3.6.4 of this chapter, and Chapter 17,
Information Technology and Security [link: 12.3.6.3, 12.3.6.4 and 17]) .
12.2.4.
Documents and Records in Laboratories
Scope of this policy is not limited to the administrative groups/sections of the
2
ch12_document-and-records-management_en_20180401_cl

University. While flexibility in education and research activities is advocated
within the University, all faculty and other employees working in support of
the academic and research functions of the University are responsible for
following this policy when they prepare, acquire, and/or preserve any of the
documents subject to this policy, known as Corporate Documents[link:
12.8.2].
Examples of Corporate Documents prepared or managed in laboratories
includes, but is not limited to:
 Purchase requests of research equipment
 Plans and reports about budget execution
 Grant applications
 Records of research evaluations
 Minutes and distributed materials of the Faculty Assembly or
other committees
Research data, lab notebooks, research papers, and other similar documents
and records that are prepared in research activities and which are not
intended for the organizational use of the University are not regarded as
Corporate Documents.
12.3. Rules
The University recognizes the value of documenting institutional decisions – not
only decisions themselves but also the process of making them – and recording of
its business transactions; it also recognizes the importance of preserving these
records traceable and available for current business purpose, for external and
internal reviews and audits, and for future historical research.
12.3.1.
Acquired Corporate Documents
All documents and records – whether electronic or on paper – acquired by
University officers and employees during their course of work through
business communication with external entities are treated as Corporate
Documents. Typical examples include notifications or inquiries from the
central and local authorities, business letters from other institutions, and
proposals from companies.
Information regarding titles, sender, and destination must be appropriately
recorded.
12.3.2.
Prepared Corporate Documents
All institutional decisions and business transactions must be documented
except for those on trivial matters. Corporate Documents must be prepared at
the time of or as soon as practicable after the event to which they relate.

3
ch12_document-and-records-management_en_20180401_cl

12.3.2.1.
Corporate Documents recording institutional decisionmaking are to certify that the decisions have been made by the
individuals with the authority to approve the concerned matters.
(Refer to the Chapter 2, Governance and Organization [link: 2].)
12.3.2.2.
Any such approval should be made in a way in which the
authenticity is assured – affixing his/her own seal, writing his/her
signature, or recording the approval through the related electronic
system – after completing necessary work flows.
The “Guideline for Document-based Approval Process” [link:]
developed and updated by the Chief Operating Officer (COO) will
provide standardized formats and procedures to be used.
12.3.3.
Principles Applied to Preparation of Corporate
Documents
Preparation. The following principles are applied to preparation of any of
Corporate Document:
12.3.3.1.
Must be Accurate. Any Corporate Document prepared by
University officers or employees must provide a correct reflection of
what was done, communicated or decided. They must be simple,
explicit, and using easy-to-understand words and phrases.
12.3.3.2.
Must be Identifiable. Every Corporate Document must be
uniquely identified by a document number, the date of preparation,
and a title appropriately representing its contents and version
information (if the document has been revised or is expected to be
revised) based on the identification standard of Corporate Document
established and maintained by the COO.
12.3.3.3.
Must be Bilingual. Any Corporate Document is to be
prepared both in English and Japanese. While the internal official
and governing language is English, accurate Japanese translation
should be added in side-by-side or other appropriate formats in order
to be accountable for the University’s business operations and its
budget executions to the Japanese funding source, local stakeholders,
and the general public in Japan.
12.3.3.3.1. However, in one of the following circumstances, a Corporate
Document may be prepared in either English or Japanese and at
least with a translated title. (It is still encouraged to make
4
ch12_document-and-records-management_en_20180401_cl

translation of its summary in the other language.)
 The document is routinely prepared.
 The need for preparation of the document is
immediate and urgent.
 It is impractical or significantly inefficient to translate
the document.
12.3.4.

Classification and Preservation

12.3.4.1.

Classification of Corporate Documents

years”) is set based on the criteria [link:] established and
periodically reviewed by the COO.
The preservation period is calculated from the first day (April 1st)
of the following fiscal year (or of the following academic year, if it
is deemed appropriate by the department head) when the
Corporate Documents were prepared, except for when the
preservation period is less than one year, in which case the date
of preparation or acquisition is the starting date of calculation.
If there is any specific statutory requirement regarding
preservation periods and/or the preservation period expiration
dates, such requirement must be met.
12.3.4.2.

Corporate Document Files

period of preservation at the Section. However, if a Section
needs to preserve some Corporate Documents Files under the
control of the Section for more than 5 years provided that the File
contains some Corporate Documents frequently used for daily business,
or for other appropriate reasons, the Section shall request for
permission to the University Archivist (s) (an employee(s)
assigned by the COO).

COO (as well as endorsed by the concerned department head when
the proposal is made by the University Archivist.).
12.3.5.1.1. When the preservation periods are extended, the length of
the extended periods must be specified and informed to the
University Archivist (s).

Chapter 13. Safety, Health & Environmental Protection
13.1 Policy
Through an array of orientation programs including safety matters, research- and jobspecific safety and education and training courses, and health and wellness programs,
OIST Graduate University (“the University”) promotes the safety and health of its
students, employees, and others within the University Community. The University also
strives to carry out the activities that comprise and support its education and research
mission in a manner that will preserve and protect the distinctive natural environment in
which the campus is located. This includes conscientious recycling and appropriate
handling and disposal of hazardous waste and other waste materials, as well as
utilization of energy efficient practices and modalities. Additionally, because Okinawa
is located in a unique geological region subject to earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, and
other natural disasters (and associated fires), the University has in place rigorous
Disaster and Emergency Preparedness protocols and training for students and
employees.
It is University policy to meet or exceed all legal and regulatory requirements
regarding Safety, Health & Environmental Protection (“SHEP”) and may impose
additional requirements as appropriate. Each member of the University community is
expected to comply with the University’s policies, rules, and procedures regarding
safety (including disaster preparedness), health, and environmental protection in
addition to complying with all relevant Japanese legal requirements. The dedication
and active commitment of every individual regarding SHEP is critical to the success
of the University’s safety, health, environmental protection, and disaster preparedness
programs.
13.1.1 General Safety Policy
General workplace safety training is important for everyone at the University,
even those who believe that they have a non-hazardous desk job. Safety
training is one of the most basic and important functions of the University.
Safety training provides insight into potential hazards in the workplace, how to
ch13_safety-health-and-environmental-protection_en_20180222_ar

spot them, and what to do once a hazard is recognized. Several forms of
training are available, such as group instruction, WEB-based training, or oneon-one sessions. The University requires that all those who operate in the
University take safety training programs, including the Basics of Health and
Safety program which extensively covers workplace safety matters [link:
13.3.1], and renew program certifications as necessary.
13.1.1.1 Job-Specific Safety Policy. Numerous hazards are jobspecific. Operation of machine tools, electrical work, construction,
plumbing, and just about any effort involving machinery will expose
those doing that work to dangers. Work involving these dangers is
subject to stringent occupational safety regulation and training, and
those who are engaged in those occupations (or those otherwise
carrying-out such activities) at the University must take the relevant
safety training [link: 13.3.2].
13.1.1.2 Research Safety Policy. Different experiments pose different
potential risks. Individuals involved in conducting experiments must
familiarize themselves with all potential risks before starting the
experiment so that they can anticipate possible incidents, ensure to
follow safe experimental procedures and take safety measures to
prevent incidents. Additionally, Faculty members and Lead
Investigators must instruct research personnel about appropriate safety
measures, and research personnel must follow their instructions and
advice. If an accident occurs, OIST personnel must implement
appropriate first-aid responses, giving priority to rescuing activities
and attending to injured people, and to preventing the spread of
damage.
13.1.2

Health & Wellness Policy

The University offers training, programs and medical services to promote the
physical and mental health and well being of employees and students and to
support a healthy and productive work environment. Employees and
students are expected to engage in the University’s Health & Wellness
programs, to be conscious of their health, to undergo periodic general and
specific medical examinations[link: 41.3.1], to pay attention to diet and
nutrition, to exercise daily, to get enough sleep each night, and to take time
for relaxation and recreation.

ch13_safety-health-and-environmental-protection_en_20180222_ar

13.1.3 Environmental Protection Policy
The University is committed to the continuous development of technologies
related to renewable energy, to research in the environmental and
associated sciences, and to minimization of energy consumption in its
activities. All employees and students are expected to behave in
conformance with the University’s policy of reducing environmental
impact, reducing waste, managing and handling of hazardous waste, and
maximizing energy efficiency.
13.1.4 Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Response Policy
In order to minimize the adverse impact of the unpredictable natural and
other disasters that may strike, the University has developed and deployed
preparedness and emergency response plans. It has also established
evacuation areas, evacuation routes, and emergency contacts. University
employees and students are expected to familiarize themselves with these
preparations, plans and precautions. All members of the University
community are expected to also have personal plans for dealing with
disasters and emergencies away from the University. For details, see “OIST
Graduate University Emergency, Safety and Health Procedures and
Guidelines” [link:
https://groups.oist.jp/sites/default/files/imce/u745/ESH_procedur
es_and_guidelines_e_Lab1.pdf].
13.2 General Considerations
13.2.1
Industrial Safety & Health Act and Other Significant Laws
With regard to occupational safety and health, the University’s activities are
subject to Japan’s Industrial Safety and Health Act [link:
http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=1926&vm=
&re ]. In addition, the University has its own Safety and Health
Management Rules [link:
https://groups.oist.jp/sites/default/files/imce/u318/docs/safetyand-health-management-rules.pdf] and a University Safety and Health
Committee [link:
https://groups.oist.jp/sites/default/files/imce/u300/Rules%20for%20Safety%
20and%20Health%20Committee_dor_0.pdf]. Also, additional laws
applicable to the University’s various research and academic activities are
set out where relevant elsewhere in this Chapter.
13.2.2

Export and Import Compliance
ch13_safety-health-and-environmental-protection_en_20180222_ar

Japan, like most nations, imposes controls, requirements, and duties on the
export and import of virtually all goods, including materials and equipment
used in basic research of the type conducted at the University. Of grave
concern are items, devices, substances, information, and specimens that
could be diverted to a military use. Intellectual property such as software,
production know-how, and even use manuals are also regulated and
controlled by Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law (Foreign
Exchange Law). Generally, licenses are required for the export of controlled
goods. The government also controls, and may require licenses for, the
importing of a variety of items, devices, substances, information, and
specimens, including living organisms. Genetically modified organisms are
a particular concern in Japan. Goods approved for importation may also be
subject to fees/taxes (sometimes referred to as “duties”), although items
used in university-based research may be eligible for an exemption from
duties. Great care must be exercised and advice from the person in charge at
the Occupational Health and Safety Section sought to assure export/import
control compliance; for pertinent details, refer to:
• The OIST Rules for Security Export Control [link:
https://groups.oist.jp/sites/default/files/imce/u318/docs/rules-forsecurity-export-control.pdf]

Transportation of many research materials, devices, and substances is
subject to strict regulations, under the provisions of the Postal Act, Terms
and Conditions of Domestic Postal Services, Universal Postal Convention,
and IATA Dangerous Goods Rules, among others. Additionally, containers
and packaging for transport within Japan and overseas must comply with
specific requirements.
Relevant laws affecting import/export of biological agents and chemical
materials include:

13.3.16 Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Response Rules Prevention of
hazardous incidents and appropriate responses under an emergency situation is
possible if each person knows what an emergency situation is like and what to
do in response. Employees and students must maintain preparedness by
periodically reviewing emergency response procedures, emergency contacts,
evacuation routes, for the areas where they work. Employees and students must
read and understand “University Emergency, Safety, Health Procedures &
Guidelines” [link:

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules and Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 14 Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer
14.1 Policy
Although the research and teaching missions of the OIST Graduate University (the
University) take precedence over development of intellectual property, the
University recognizes that its teaching and research have the potential to generate
an array of new ideas, processes, materials, devices and the like, which may be of
benefit to the larger world as well as to the University.
Owners of qualifying new or novel ideas, processes, materials, devices, creations,
and discoveries may be granted exclusive rights to use and commercialize their
intellectual property. Thus, intellectual property has the potential to generate
unrestricted income to support the University’s research and education. After its
faculty, students, staff and other human resources, intellectual property is the
University’s most important asset.
Consequently, all intellectual property (IP) conceived, created, developed, or first
reduced to practice in whole or in part by members of the University’s faculty
(including student employees) or staff in the course of their University
responsibilities, or with more than incidental use of University resources (which
may be the case with visiting scholars and others not in the University's employ),
belongs to the University unless otherwise provided. All members of the University
community are expected to preserve, manage and protect IP in the same manner
as they would for any other University asset. Even an invention that may not be
patentable for any reason may still be valuable and important - for example, as a
trade secret [link: 14.8.9] or as technical "know-how."
It is University policy that royalties and similar remuneration deriving from its IP
shall be shared [link: 14.3.7.3] with the inventor/author.
In addition to faculty and staff (including student employees), the provisions of the
University's IP policy extends to:
 All graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and
 Non-employees who participate in research projects at the
University (e.g., visiting faculty, industrial personnel, fellows,
etc.).
1
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

14.2 General Considerations
14.2.1 Confidentiality Obligations.
Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agreements raise significant concerns.
The terms of such an agreement may conflict with the University’s
Openness in Research Policy [link: 1.3.1]. A contractual commitment to
keep information secret can severely restrict the ability of University faculty
to pursue research in the manner they choose and can make it impossible
for the University to protect ideas and inventions deriving from the work of
its faculty and researchers. Once signed, any violation of a nondisclosure or
confidentiality agreement can result in an injunction or monetary damages
being assessed against the discloser. It is imperative that the General
Counsel [link: 2.5] be consulted whenever it appears that the University
may be the recipient of information or items that are proprietary,
confidential, or otherwise subject to a promise not to disclose. It is
forbidden to sign or otherwise bind the University to a confidentiality
obligation without first having obtained written approval from the General
Counsel.
14.2.2 Intellectual Property
“Intellectual Property” includes, among other things, new or novel devices,
processes, compounds, materials, and authored works (such as software)
that may be eligible for protection under laws governing patents [link:
14.8.6], copyrights [link: 14.8.2], trademarks [link: 14.8.10], and trade
secrets [link: 14.8.9].
14.2.3 More than incidental use of University resources
“More than incidental use of University resources” [link: 14.8.5] refers to
more than minimal use of specialized, research-related facilities, equipment,
supplies, or staff provided by the University for academic purposes, as well
as significant use of "on-the-job" time.
The occasional and infrequent use of the following would typically not
constitute “more than incidental use of University resources”:



Routinely available, office-type equipment, including desktop
computers and commercially-available software, and
Reference materials or other resources collected on the University
campus, and which are generally available in non-University
locations.

ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

14.2.4 Assignment of Rights
If the Technology Licensing Section (TLS) cannot, or decides not to, proceed
in a timely manner to patent and/or license an invention, TLS may assign
ownership to the inventor or inventors upon request to the extent possible
under the terms of any agreement with a sponsoring agency that supported
or related to the work. In such cases, the inventor may request and be
granted rights by the sponsoring agency to an invention made under such
an agreement provided that a well-conceived and detailed plan for
commercial development accompanies the request.
14.2.5 Public Domain
Following consultation with the TLS, the inventor, or inventors acting
collectively when there are more than one, may place inventions in the
public domain [link: 14.8.7] if that would be in the best interest of
technology transfer and if doing so is not in violation of the terms of any
agreements that supported or governed the work. The University will not
assert IP rights when inventors have thus placed their inventions in the
public domain.
14.2.6 Reports
Agencies sponsoring research at the University usually require reports of all
inventions, whether or not they are considered patentable.
14.3 Rules
14.3.1 Duty to Disclose Potential IP
All potentially patentable inventions or copyrightable works that were
conceived or first reduced to practice in whole or in part by members of the
faculty or staff (including student employees) of the University in the course
of their University responsibilities, or with more than incidental use of
University resources, must be disclosed on a timely basis to the University,
through its TLS using the form “Invention Disclosure Form [link: 14.6]”.
14.3.1.1 Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, visiting researchers
and scientist, and other non-employees must disclose to the
University all potentially patentable inventions conceived or first
reduced to practice in whole or in part in the course of participation
in research projects at the University, or with more than incidental
use of University resources.

3
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

14.3.1.2 Title to such inventions shall be assigned to the University
(PCA) [link: 14.6], regardless of the funding source.
14.3.2 Confidentiality Obligation
No member of the University may sign an agreement binding the University
to a confidentiality obligation without first obtaining written approval to do
so from the General Counsel (See 14.2.1 [link: 14.2.1]).
14.3.3 Royalty Sharing
The University shall share royalties [link: 14.3.7.3] from inventions assigned
to the University with the inventor in accordance with provisions set out
elsewhere in this Policy.
14.3.4 Assignment of Ownership
(See 14.2.4[link: 14.2.4]).
14.3.5 Waivers
Waivers of the provisions of this policy may be granted by the President or
the President's designate on a case-by-case basis, giving consideration to,
among other things, the University’s obligations to sponsors, whether the
waiver would be in the best interest of technology transfer, whether the
waiver would be in the best interest of the University, and whether the
waiver would result in a conflict of interest. In addition, the President may
expand upon these provisions and shall adopt rules, based on the same
factors as well as appropriateness to the University's relationship with
inventors, for the ownership of potentially patentable inventions created or
discovered with more than incidental use of University resources by
students when not working as employees of the University, by visiting
scholars and by others not in the University's employ.
14.3.6 Rules Regarding Patents
14.3.6.1 Patent Agreements. All faculty, staff, student employees,
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows must sign the OIST
Graduate University Patent and Copyright Agreement (“PCA”) [link:
14.6] at the time of their assignment. In addition, non-employees
who participate or intend to participate in research projects at the
University must also sign a PCA.
A variation of this agreement has been created for individuals with
prior obligations regarding the disclosure and assignment of
4
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

intellectual property. See, “OIST Graduate University Patent &
Copyright Agreement for Personnel at OIST Graduate University
Who Have a Prior Existing and Conflicting Intellectual Property
Agreement with Another Employer (PCA2) [link: 14.6]”.   Each
hiring division is responsible for getting a PCA, or PCA2, signed at
the time of the individual's initial association with the University.
14.3.6.2 Invention Disclosures [link: 14.8.4]. Inventors must prepare
and submit on a timely basis an invention disclosure for each
potentially patentable invention conceived or first actually reduced
to practice in whole or in part in the course of their University
responsibilities or with more than incidental use of University
resources.  An Invention Disclosure Form [link: 14.6] describing the
invention and including other related facts should be prepared by the
inventor and forwarded to TLS. TLS shall decide whether the
invention should be evaluated at the Business Potential Evaluation
Committee [link: ] in 10 business days.
14.3.6.2.1 Practical Considerations. Individuals covered by
this policy are expected to apply reasonable good faith
judgment as to whether a new finding may qualify as an
invention [link: 14.8.3] to be disclosed to the University for
evaluation for potential patentability. The TLS will decide
whether to convene the Business Potential Evaluation
Committee to evaluate the value of the invention with
appropriate professional expertise at the earliest possible date.
14.3.6.2.2 Value of Unpatented Inventions. An invention,
although not patentable for any reason, may still be valuable
and important - for example, trade secrets and technical
“know-how” encompassing proprietary information of a
valuable and confidential nature.   Agencies sponsoring
research at the University usually require reports of all
inventions, whether or not they are considered patentable.
14.3.7 Patent Licensing
The University encourages the development of inventions and technology
resulting from University research by industry for public use and benefit. It
recognizes that protection of proprietary rights in the form of a patent or
copyright are often necessary - particularly with inventions derived from
basic research - to encourage a company to risk the investment of its
5
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

personnel and financial resources to develop the invention. In some cases
an exclusive license may be necessary to provide an incentive for a company
to undertake commercial development and production. Nonexclusive
licenses allow several companies to exploit an invention.
Not all inventions are patentable. Questions relating to patentability are
often complex and usually require professional assistance. Nonetheless, it
can be said that an important criterion of patentability is that an invention
must not be obvious to a person with ordinary skill in that particular field.
It must also be novel, in the sense that it not have been previously publicly
known or used by others or patented or described in a printed publication
anywhere.
14.3.7.1 Priorities. The research and teaching missions of the
University always take precedence over patent considerations. While
the University recognizes the benefits of patent development, it is
most important that the direction of University research not be
established or unduly influenced by patent considerations or
personal financial interests. This priority to research and teaching
does not exonerate inventors of their obligation to disclose
inventions to TLS.
14.3.7.2 Responsibility for Licensing. The TLS handles the evaluation,
marketing, negotiation and licensing of University-owned inventions
with commercial potential.
14.3.7.3 Royalty Distribution and Equity Participation. Cash
royalties and equity participation shall be handled, in principle, as
set forth below.
14.3.7.3.1 Cash Royalties. After deductions for TLS expenses,
royalty income is divided one-third to the inventor, one-third
to the inventor’s laboratory, and one-third to the University.
When more than one laboratory is involved, the inventor shall
designate the distribution of the one-third allocated for the
laboratory based on support of the work. If the inventor’s
laboratory dissolved, the University shall assign the
distribution of the laboratory to the University.
14.3.7.3.1.1 A deduction of 15% to cover the
administrative overhead of the TLS is taken from gross
6
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

royalty income, followed by a deduction for any directly
assignable expenses, typically patent filing fees.
14.3.7.3.1.2
Disagreements
involving
royalty
distribution will be reviewed and resolved by the TLS;
involved parties may appeal the TLS resolution to the
President.
14.3.7.3.2 Equity Participation. The University may at times
accept equity from a corporate licensee as part of the licensing
agreement (all other cash payments, including royalties based
on sales, will be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of 14.3.7.3.1, above.) 
14.3.7.4 Loss of Patentability. Inventions that are patentable initially
may become non-patentable for a variety of reasons. An invention
becomes non-patentable if a formal application is not filed with the
Patent Office within a prescribed period of time of disclosure in a
publication or of any other action that results in the details of the
invention becoming generally available.
14.3.7.5 Filing for International Patent Protection. International
patent protection is important for industry to develop its product
world-wide. An International Patent application may be executed
through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) route. The PCT
procedure has many advantages for the applicant, including giving
the applicant up to 18 months to seek protection in foreign countries.
14.3.8 Rules Regarding Copyright
Copyright is the ownership and control of the intellectual property in
original works of authorship, including software, which are subject to
copyright law. It is the policy of the University that all rights in copyright
shall remain with the creator unless the work is a “work-for-hire” (the
contract for the work stipulates that copyright vests in the University), is
supported by a direct allocation of funds through the University for the
pursuit of a specific project, is commissioned by the University, makes more
than incidental use of University resources or personnel, or is otherwise
subject to contractual obligations. 
The Copyright Policy of the University is intended to accomplish the
following:
7
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl







Enable the University to foster the free and creative
expression and exchange of ideas and comment;
Preserve traditional University practices and privileges with
respect to the publication of scholarly works;
Establish principles and procedures for sharing income
derived from copyrightable material produced at the
University; and
Protect the University's assets and imprimatur.

All faculty, staff, student employees, graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows, as well as non-employees who participate or intend to participate
in teaching and/or research or scholarship projects at the University are
bound by this policy. They are also required to sign a Patent & Copyright
Agreement (PCA or PCA2) [link: 14.6]. The PCA assigns, with certain
exceptions, rights to copyrightable works resulting from University projects
to the University. However, this policy applies, and those subject to this
policy are deemed to assign their rights to copyrightable works, whether or
not a PCA is signed and is on file.   Royalty income received by the
University for such works will normally be distributed in accordance with
University policy set forth below. Physical embodiments of copyrightable
works may also be subject to the University’s Tangible Research Policy [link:
14.3.9].
14.3.8.1 Scope of Copyright Protection. Copyright protection does
not extend to any idea, process, concept, discovery or the like, but
only to the work in which it may be embodied, illustrated, or
explained. For example, a written description of a manufacturing
process is copyrightable, but the copyright only prevents
unauthorized copying of the description; the process described could
be freely copied unless it enjoys some other protection, such as
patent. Subject to various exceptions and limitations provided for in
the copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to
reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies by
sale or otherwise, and display or perform the work publicly.
Ownership of copyright is distinct from the ownership of any
material object in which the work may be embodied. For example, if
one purchases a videotape, one does not necessarily obtain the right
to make a public showing for profit. 
14.3.8.1.1 Books, Article, and Similar Works, including Non8
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

patentable Software. Except to the extent set forth in this
Chapter, the University does not claim ownership to
pedagogical, scholarly, or artistic works, regardless of their
form of expression. Such works include those of students
created in the course of their education, such as dissertations,
papers and articles. The University claims no ownership of
popular nonfiction, novels, textbooks, poems, musical
compositions, non-patentable software, or other works of
artistic imagination, which are not institutional works and did
not make significant use of University resources or the
services of University non-faculty employees working within
the scope of their employment.
14.3.8.2 Institutional Works. The University shall retain ownership
of works created as institutional works. Institutional works include
works that are supported by a specific allocation of University funds
or that are created at the direction of the University for a specific
University purpose. Institutional works also include works whose
authorship cannot be attributed to one or a discrete number of
authors but rather result from simultaneous or sequential
contributions over time by multiple faculty and students. For
example, software tools developed and improved over time by
multiple faculty and students where authorship is not appropriately
attributed to a single or defined group of authors would constitute an
institutional work. However, the mere fact that multiple individuals
have contributed to the creation of a work does not, in-and-of itself,
compel the conclusion that the work constitutes an institutional
work.
14.3.8.3 Works of Non-Employees. Works by non-employees, such
as consultants, independent contractors, etc. (“third-party nonemployees”) generally are owned by the creator and not by the
University, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.
However, as it is University policy that the University obtains
ownership of such works, the University will generally require a
written agreement from third-party non-employees that ownership
of such works will be assigned to the University and the third-party
non-employees will agree not to prevent the University from freely
using and licensing the copyrighted material. All faculty, staff,
student employees, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as
well as non-employees who participate or intend to participate in
9
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

teaching and/or research or scholarship projects at the University
are required to contact the General Counsel immediately to execute
a proper agreement with any third-party non-employees. Examples
of works which the University may retain third-party non-employees
to prepare are:
 Contract Research
 Reports by consultants or subcontractors
 Computer software
 Architectural or engineering drawings
 Illustrations or designs
 Artistic works
14.3.8.3.1 As discussed in Chapter 21, Use of University
Resources [link: 21], the University’s resources are to be used
solely for University purposes and not for personal gain or
personal commercial advantage, nor for any other nonUniversity purposes. Therefore, if the creator of a
copyrightable work makes more than incidental use [link:
14.8.5] of the services of University non-faculty employees or
University resources to create the work, he or she shall
disclose the work to the TLS and assign title to the University.
Questions about what constitutes incidental use should be
directed to the Executive Vice President for Technology
Development and Innovation .
14.3.8.4 Open Source Software. The University encourages the
exploration of open source software solutions in any areas of
application for research use. The University provides, for software
intended for distribution under an open source license, a general
waiver of the policy that the IP rights in software reside with the
University and must not be distributed without explicit permission.
The University encourages all staff members involved in software
development for research purpose to make that software available
under Open Source license terms (for example, the GNU General
Public License), and to contribute, as appropriate, to existing open
source software projects.
14.3.8.5 Videotaping and related Classroom Technology. Courses
taught and courseware developed for teaching at the University
belongs to the University. Any courses that are videotaped or
recorded using any media are property of the University, and may
10
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

not be further distributed without permission from the Dean of
Graduate School. Blanket permission is provided for evanescent
video or other copies for the use of students, or for other University
purposes. Prior to videotaping, permission should be obtained from
anyone who will appear in the final program as well as from the Vice
President for Communications and Public Relations (Chapter
16[link: 16]).
14.3.8.6 Contractual Obligations of the University. This Copyright
Policy shall not be interpreted to limit the University’s ability to meet
its obligations for deliverables under any contract, grant, or other
arrangement with third parties, including sponsored research
agreements, license agreements and the like. Copyrightable works
that are subject to sponsored research agreements, or other
contractual obligations of the University, shall be owned by the
University, so that the University may satisfy its contractual
obligations.
14.3.8.7 Reconveyance of Copyright to Creator. When copyright is
assigned to the University because of the provisions of this policy, the
creator of the copyrighted material may make a request to the
General Counsel that ownership be reassigned to the creator. Such a
request can, at the discretion of the General Counsel, be granted if it
does not:
(i) violate any legal obligations of or to the University,
(ii) limit appropriate University uses of the materials,
(iii) create a real or potential conflict of interest for the creator,
or
(iv) otherwise conflict with University goals or principles.
14.3.8.8 Administration of Policy. Questions of ownership or other
matters pertaining to materials covered by this policy shall be
resolved by the General Counsel.
14.3.8.9 Licensing and Income Sharing. The TLS seeks the most
effective means of technology transfer for public use and benefit and,
toward that end, is responsible for the evaluation, marketing,
negotiation and licensing of University-owned inventions or
copyrightable materials with commercial potential.   Computer
databases, software and firmware, and other copyrightable works
owned by the University, are licensed through TLS. Exceptions to
11
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

this procedure must be approved in advance by the Executive Vice
President for Technology Development and Innovation.
14.3.8.10 Royalty Distribution. Royalties will normally be allocated
in accordance with the University’s policy set out in this Chapter
under Royalty Distribution & Equity Participation [link: 14.3.7.3]. If
copyright protection alone is claimed, royalties normally will be
allocated in a similar manner, with the “inventor's share” allocated
among individuals identified by the relevant faculty member (or
project head if not under a sponsored agreement), based on their
relative contributions to the work. Where royalty distribution to
individuals would be impracticable or inequitable (for example,
when the copyrightable material has been developed as a laboratory
project, or where individual royalty distribution could distort
academic priorities), the “inventor’s share” may be allocated to a
research account in the laboratory where the copyrightable material
was developed. If the inventor’s laboratory dissolved, the University
shall assign the distribution of the laboratory to the University. Such
determination will be made on a case-by-case basis by the TLS after
consultation with the faculty member or the Dean of Research , and
is subject to the approval of the Executive Vice President for
Technology Development and Innovation.
14.3.8.11 Assignments. No assignment, license or other agreement
may be entered into or will be considered valid with respect to
copyrighted works owned by the University except by an official
specifically authorized to do so.
14.3.8.12 Use of the University Name in Copyright Notices (See
Chapter 16 “External and Internal and Public Relations”[link: 16]).
No other institutional, department, laboratory, or project name is to
be used in the copyright notice, although the name and address of
the laboratory or project to which readers can direct inquiries may
be listed below the copyright notice. The date in the notice should be
the year in which the work is first published, i.e., distributed to the
public or any sizable audience. Additionally, works may be registered
with the Copyright Office using its official forms. Forms may be
obtained from the TLS, to which questions concerning copyright
notices and registration also may be addressed.

12
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

14.3.8.13 Copying of Works Owned by Others. Members of the
University community are cautioned to observe the rights of other
copyright owners. Contact the Dean of the Graduate School l’s office
or the General Counsel concerning policies pertaining to copying for
classroom use. Policies regarding copying for library purposes may
be obtained from the office of the University Librarian (Chapter
6.3.4[link: 6.3.4]).
14.3.8.14 Sponsored Agreements. Contracts and grants frequently
contain complex provisions relating to copyright, rights in data,
royalties, publication and various categories of material including
proprietary data, computer software, licenses, etc. Questions
regarding the specific terms and conditions of individual contracts
and grants, or regarding rules, regulations and statutes applicable to
the various government agencies, should be addressed to the
University's Grants and Research Collaborations (GRC) [link: 2.5].
14.3.9 Rules Regarding Tangible Research Property (TRP)
The following is directed toward the administration and distribution of
Tangible Research Property (TRP) [link: 14.8.8], which is owned and/or
controlled by the University. TRP may be subject to the University’s
contractual obligations and these rules are to be interpreted and applied
consistent with and complementary to other policies affecting the
administration of tangible properties.
14.3.9.1 Ownership of TRP. TRP normally is either owned by the
University or is subject to the ownership and other provisions of
contracts and grants. For example, items such as microorganisms
produced under a government grant or contract usually belong to the
University as expendable property, subject to the terms and
conditions of the grant or contract. Equipment fabricated at the
University for subsequent off-campus use by a research sponsor (e.g.,
an instrument fabricated at the University under contract with the
sponsor) is usually owned exclusively by the sponsor.
14.3.9.2 Control of TRP. It is the responsibility of the faculty member
(or laboratory director or project head, if the TRP is not developed as
part of a Gransts and Research Collaborations project) to control the
development, storage, use, and distribution of TRP made in the
course of research activity, subject to provisions of applicable grants
or contracts and University policy. Such control includes
13
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

determining if and when distribution of the TRP is to be made
beyond the laboratory for scientific use by others.
14.3.9.3 Freedom of Access. The University’s Openness in Research
Policy [link: 1.3.1], states: “... the principle of openness in research the principle of freedom of access by all interested persons to the
underlying data, to the processes, and to the final results of research
- is one of overriding importance.” Consistent with this principle, it
is the University’s policy to promote the prompt and open exchange
of TRP and associated research data with scientific colleagues
outside the investigator’s immediate laboratory.
14.3.9.4 Commercial Considerations. Because TRP may have
potential commercial value as well as scientific value, the
investigator may wish to make TRP broadly available for scientific
use by others by means that do not diminish its value or inhibit its
commercial development or public use. Although valid noncommercial reasons may exist for the temporary delay of TRP
distribution outside the laboratory for scientific use by others (e.g.,
safety factors or the need to more fully characterize the TRP prior to
distribution, etc.) scientific exchanges should not be inhibited due to
potential commercial considerations.
14.3.9.4.1 Income from TRP. TRP may not be sold for profit,
although licensing agreements, which include provision for
royalty income may be negotiated through the TLS for
commercial use of the intangible property rights associated
with the TRP. When distributing TRP to research colleagues
outside the laboratory, costs of the raw materials and
handling may be recovered from the recipient, with the
income returned to the account, which funded those costs.
14.3.9.4.2 Contractual Obligations. If any of the initial costs
were funded from sponsored agreements, the SRS should be
asked to advise on the contractual obligations regarding
distribution of the TRP and disposition of the recovered costs.
If any costs are charged for TRP distribution, adequate
documentation must be maintained for audit purposes.
14.3.9.5 TRP Procedures. The following procedures for identification
and distribution of TRP are designed to aid the traditional open
14
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

distribution and exchange of TRP for research purposes, preserve the
potential commercial value of TRP, assist the further development of
TRP for public use, and protect the University and its employees
from liability claims arising from the use of University TRP by others.
14.3.9.5.1 Identification System. When public or commercial
values were identified by the above evaluation, each item of
TRP must have an unambiguous identification code and name
sufficient to distinguish it from other similar items developed
at the University or elsewhere. The TLS should be consulted
for assistance in developing appropriate identification
systems and for information regarding use of existing
University systems.
14.3.9.5.2 Ownership of Marks. Where applicable (e. g.,
computer software), each item should also carry the name of
the TRP owner and such other marks and legends as may be
required to meet the University’s contractual obligations and
administrative needs, including notice of copyright,
trademark, government rights, etc.  Information regarding
identification, marks, and legends required under research
contracts and grants can be obtained from the SRS or TLS.
14.3.9.6 Distribution of TRP for Research Purposes. Each
distribution for non-commercial research purposes should be
accompanied by a letter of transmittal which includes the following,
or equivalent, wording: 
"For OIST Graduate University records, please indicate
your agreement (1) to accept S- (insert Biological
Registry No.) to be used only for non-clinical research
by you in your research laboratory, and (2) to not
distribute S- to any other individual or entity, by
signing and returning a copy of this letter to me."
14.3.9.6.1 CAUTION: If there is a possibility of biohazard or
other risk associated with the transport, storage or use of a
particular TRP, or if the recipient is likely to use the TRP for
clinical research, the Research Safety Section should be
consulted regarding appropriate precautionary language in
the TRP distribution agreement. Alternatively, SRS can
15
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

provide standard TRP distribution forms or Material Transfer
Agreement [link: ], which contain appropriate precautionary
language. (Note: For information about regulations regarding
transfer of infectious agents or recombinant DNA material,
contact
the
Research
Safety
Section
(research_safety@oist.jp[link: ]).)
14.3.9.7 TRP Software Distribution. Distribution, for research
purposes only, of computer software owned by the University may be
made without restrictions if control of subsequent use by the faculty
member is not desired. For example, a faculty member may wish
recipients to follow a specific research protocol. Any such
distribution is subject to the applicable contract or grant provisions
and an agreement by the recipient that commercial development of
the software is not to be undertaken.
14.3.9.7.1 TRP Distribution Agreement.  If software owned by
the University has commercial value or if it is considered
desirable to control subsequent use, distribution for research
purposes must be coordinated with TLS and must be
accompanied by an appropriate agreement with the recipient.
TLS will arrange for trademark and copyright registration as
needed. TLS will also provide wording for the distribution
agreement as necessary to preserve commercial value and
provide coordination with existing or prospective commercial
licensing activities.
14.3.9.7.2 TRP Contractual Obligations.   When software
results from Gransts and Research Collaborations, SRS
should be consulted regarding contractual obligations and
regulations affecting ownership, disposition of various rights,
and restrictions on the distribution and use of TRP and any
associated income with TLS support.
14.3.9.8 Other Forms of TRP. Distribution of TRP other than
biological products should normally follow the procedures outlined
above for the example of computer software.
14.3.9.9 Distribution of TRP for Commercial Purposes. If TRP
developed by the University as a result of research activities is to be
distributed to outside users for commercial purposes, the
16
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

distribution agreement must contain provisions negotiated by TLS
covering the terms under which the property may be used, limits on
the University’s liability for the property or products derived
therefrom, and disposition of any royalty income to the University
from the licensing of intangible property rights associated with the
use of the tangible property.
14.3.9.10 Income Distribution. Distribution of any TRP-related
royalty income other than patent royalties will be similar to the
patent royalty income distribution policy [link: 14.3.7.3] except that
the “inventor’s share” will normally be distributed to a research
account in the laboratory which produced the TRP (subject to any
contractual obligations regarding distribution of income). Questions
regarding distribution of any royalty income to individuals should be
referred to TLS. Any distribution to individuals is subject to prior
approval of the Executive Vice President for Technology
Development and Innovation.
14.3.9.11 Contractual Obligations. If the TRP results from Gransts
and Research Collaborations, the SRS [link: 2.5] should be consulted
regarding contractual obligations and regulations affecting
ownership, notices, acknowledgments, disposition of various rights,
and restrictions on the distribution and use of the TRP and any
associated income.
14.3.10 Other Intellectual Property
14.3.10.1 Trade and Service Marks. Trade and service marks
(collectively, “marks”) are distinctive words or graphic symbols
identifying the sources, product, producer, or distributor of goods or
services. Trade or service marks relating to goods or services
distributed by the University are owned by the University; see
Chapter 15 [link: 15]. Examples include names and symbols used in
conjunction with computer programs or University activities and
events. Consult the TLS for information about registration and
protection of marks. Consult the Office of Communication & Public
Relations for information concerning the use of University marks.
14.3.10.2 Proprietary Information and Trade Secrets. Proprietary
information arising out of University work (e.g., actual and proposed
terms of research agreements, financial arrangements, or
17
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

confidential business information) shall be owned by the University.
“Trade secret” is a legal term referring to any information, whether
or not copyrightable or patentable, which is not generally known or
accessible, and which gives competitive advantage to its owner.
Trade secrets are proprietary information. 
14.3.10.2.1 Any request that a University employee sign a
Nondisclosure or Confidentiality Agreement must be referred
to the General Counsel to ensure, among other things, that all
research involving proprietary information owned by others
is subject to the University’s Openness in Research Policy
[link: 1.3.1].
14.4 Responsibilities
14.4.1 The Grants and Research Collaborations
The Grants and Research Collaborations [link: 2.5] reviews terms and
conditions of the University’s grants and academic contracts for compliance
with University policies on intellectual property rights and openness in
research with TLS support.
14.4.2 The Technology Licensing Section
The Technology Licensing Section [link: 2.5] promotes the transfer of the
University’s technology and intellectual property for society’s use and benefit
while generating unrestricted income to support research and education.
TLS is responsible for the administration of the University’s invention
reporting and licensing program, the commercial evaluation of inventions,
patent-filing decisions, petitions to agencies for greater rights in inventions,
and negotiation of industrial agreements.
14.4.3 The Dean of Research and the Executive Vice President for
Technology Development and Innovation
The Dean of Research and the Executive Vice President for Technology
Development and Innovation respond to questions of ownership or similar
matters (through consultation with the SRS and the TLS); the Dean of
Research must inform faculty members of their responsibilities under this
Policy;
14.4.4 Dean of Research
The Dean of Research must inform faculty members of their responsibilities

14.8 Definitions
14.8.1 Confidentiality Obligation (also known as Nondisclosure
Agreement, Confidentiality Agreement)
A confidentiality obligation is any legal undertaking whereby one party
agrees to keep information disclosed by another party secret. The
obligation to keep disclosed information secret is typically accompanied by
an obligation to protect the disclosed information at least as stringently as
19
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

the recipient protects its own confidential information and an obligation
not to use the disclosed information for any purpose other than as
permitted by the agreement signed by the recipient of the information. This
obligation is typically embodied in a written Confidentiality Agreement
(CA) or Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA). The obligation to maintain
information in confidence can take many forms and such obligations are
often found in license agreements and other legal contracts.
14.8.2 Copyrightable Works
Under the copyright law, copyright subsists in “original works of authorship”
that have been fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they
can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly
or with the aid of a machine or device. These works typically include the full
array of literary, artistic, and musical works, pictorial and other graphic
works, dramatic works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, and
sound recordings. Copyright protection is also available for software and
integrated circuit masks.
Except as set out otherwise in this policy (for example, with regard
to software and integrated circuit masks), the University does not
claim ownership of pedagogical, scholarly, or artistic works,
regardless of their form of expression. Such works include those of
students created in the course of their education, such as
dissertations, papers and articles. The University claims no
ownership of popular nonfiction, novels, textbooks, poems, musical
compositions, non-patentable software, or other works of artistic
imagination, which are not institutional works and which did not
make more than incidental use of University resources or the services
of University non-faculty employees working within the scope of
their employment.
14.8.3 Invention
An invention is a novel and useful idea relating to processes, machines,
manufactures, and compositions of matter. It may cover such things as new
or improved devices, systems, circuits, chemical compounds, mixtures, etc.
It is probable that an invention has been made when something new and
useful has been conceived or developed, or when unusual, unexpected, or
nonobvious results have been obtained and can be exploited. An invention
can be made solely or jointly with others as co-inventors. To be recognized
legally, a co-inventor must have conceived of an essential element of an
invention or contributed substantially to the general concept.
20
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

14.8.4 Invention Disclosure
An invention disclosure is a document that provides information about
inventor(s), what was invented, circumstances leading to the invention, and
facts concerning subsequent activities. It provides the basis for a
determination of patentability and the technical information for drafting a
patent application. An invention disclosure is also used to report technology
that may not be patented but is protected by other means such as copyright
or trade secret.
14.8.5 More than Incidental Use
For purposes of this Chapter, the phrase “more than incidental use of
University resources” means use for more than a minimal amount of time
of specialized, research-related facilities, equipment or supplies, provided
by the University for academic purposes, and use of more than a minimal
amount of “on-the-job” time. The occasional and infrequent use of the
following would typically not constitute “more than incidental use of
University resources”:



Routinely available, office-type equipment, including desktop
computers and commercially-available software, and
Reference materials or other resources collected on the University
campus, and which are generally available in non-University
locations.

14.8.6 Patent
A patent is a grant issued by a national government office (usually called the
Patent Office) giving an inventor the right to exclude all others from making,
using, or selling the invention within the territory of the country, its
territories and possessions for a period of 20 years. When a patent
application is filed, the Patent Office reviews it to ascertain if the invention
is new, useful, and nonobvious and, if appropriate, grants a patent - usually
two to five years later. Not all patents are necessarily valuable or able to
withstand a challenge after being issued.
14.8.7 Public Domain
Public domain ownership means that society, as a whole, owns the item and
anyone can make free use of it for any purpose desired. Authorship doesn’t
have to be noted. A particular item enters the public domain when the
author or creator relinquishes her/his rights to the item or when a
predefined length of time has passed.
21
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

14.8.8 Tangible Research Property (TRP)
TRP is defined for purposes of this Chapter as tangible (or corporeal) items
produced in the course of research projects supported by the University or
by external sponsors. TRP includes such items as: biological materials,
engineering drawings, computer software, integrated circuit chips,
computer databases, prototype devices, circuit diagrams, equipment. TRP
is separate and distinct from intangible (or intellectual) property such as
inventions, patents, copyright and trademarks which are subject to other
policies and guidelines set forth above. Individual items of TRP may be
associated with one or more intangible properties such as copyright or
patents.
14.8.9 Trade secret
“Trade secret” is a legal term referring to any information, whether or not
copyrightable or patentable, which is not generally known or accessible, and
which gives competitive advantage to its owner. Trade secrets are
proprietary information. 
14.8.10 Trademark
Trade and service marks are distinctive words or graphic symbols
identifying the sources, product, producer, or distributor of goods or
services. A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies
and distinguishes the source of a service.
14.8.11 work-for-hire
“work-for-hire” is a legal term defined generally as “a work prepared by an
employee within the scope of his or her employment.” This definition
includes works prepared by employees in satisfaction of sponsored
agreements between the University and outside agencies. Certain
commissioned works also are works for hire if the parties so agree in writing.
 The employer (i.e., the University) by law is the “author,” and hence the
owner, of works for hire for copyright purposes. Works for hire subject to
this principle include works that are developed, in whole or in part, by
University employees. For example, significant use of staff or student
employee programmers or University film production personnel will
typically result in University ownership of the copyright in the resulting
work. Where a work is jointly developed by University faculty or staff or
student employees and a third-party non-employee, the copyright in the
resulting work typically will be jointly owned by the University and the third
party. In such instances, an agreement must be executed to explicitly define
22
ch14_Intellectual-Property-&-Technology-Transfer_20160901_en_cl

the rights of both the University and the other party. If a copyright jointly
shared by the third party is expected, immediate consultation with the
General Counsel is required. Whether the University claims ownership of a
work will be determined in accordance with the provisions of this policy,
and not solely based upon whether the work constitutes a work-for-hire
under the copyright law. For example, copyright in pedagogical, scholarly
or artistic works to which the University disclaims ownership under this
policy shall be held by the creators regardless of whether the work
constitutes a work-for-hire under copyright law. University ownership in a
work-for-hire may be relinquished only by an official of the University
authorized to do so by the Board of Governors.

Chapter 15. Name Use, Endorsements,
and Use of University Logo and Trademarks
15.1 Policy
The Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University
(University) is internationally known for excellence in education, research,
and scientific and technological innovation. The University name (and
abbreviated names) and its associated marks, trademarks, logos, and symbols,
and like identifying images (collectively, the "names and marks") are
internationally recognized and represent the high caliber of our faculty,
students, and staff. The names and marks convey the quality, breadth, and
depth of the University's accomplishments. This Policy is intended to protect
the unique identification and reputation of the University.
The University is the owner of its names and marks, which are among its most
valuable assets. Faculty, students and staff share in the benefits associated
with the University's name and marks, and therefore also share
responsibilities concerning their use.
Detailed information and instructions concerning the University’s Trademark
Use Policy, and its Trademark Licensing Program, can be obtained from the
Technology Transfer Section [link: 2.5]. See also Chapter 14, Intellectual
Property and Technology Transfer [link: Chapter 14].
15.2 General Considerations
15.3 Rules
Names and marks of the University may not be used in a manner that implies
endorsement of, or affiliation with, events, activities, programs, products or
services of any entity not directly associated with, or licensed in writing by, the
University.
15.3.1 Use of Names and Marks Restricted to Official
University Business
Attaching or using the University’s names and marks in connection
with any event, activity, publication, product or service is permitted
ONLY if the event, activity, publication, product or service is one for
which the University has formally accepted institutional responsibility.

15.3.1.1 Use by University Personnel
Faculty and staff may use the University names and marks
ONLY for official University business. Faculty, faculty emeriti,
and staff members using the University name and marks in
connection with activities conducted outside of the scope of their
employment must use their exact title and must not imply that
the University endorses the product or activity.
15.3.1.1.1 Personal letters may not be written on
stationery bearing the University names and marks,
especially in matters that may involve controversy,
endorsements, or solicitations for non-University
purposes.
15.3.1.2 Use by Students
Students may identify themselves on business cards as students
of the University, provided that it is clear that they are students
and not employed by or representing the University in an official
capacity(Chapter 5[link: 5]).
Students employed by the University may also include their job
title and contact information.
Students must use a University-approved vendor to obtain
business cards, to assure conformance with University style and
format requirements. Cards made using a personal computer
must also conform to University style and format; examples are
available from the Division of Communication and Public
Relations.
15.3.1.3 Use by Student Organizations
If given permission by the Vice President for Communication
and Public Relations and the Dean of the Graduate School,
approved student organizations may be permitted to use the
University’s names and marks. Proposed uses of the University
names and marks must be submitted to the Vice President for
Communication and Public Relations for review and approval in
advance.
Only student organizations that are both University-registered
and University-sponsored may submit proposals to use the
University name and marks.

15.3.1.3.1 Voluntary student organizations (those
registered with, but not sponsored by, the University) may
refer to themselves as the "OIST Graduate University
_(insert name)__________,” but they may not use any
other University names and marks. Proposed graphics
related to use of the term “OIST Graduate University” by
voluntary student organizations must be submitted to the
Vice President for Communication and Public Relations
for approval (Chapter 16.3.1 [link: 16.3.1] ) .
15.3.1.3.2 Student organizations and entities that are not
registered with the University are prohibited from any
name association with the University.
15.3.1.3.3 No student organization may use the registered
University Seal [link: 2.7] under any circumstances nor
shall they create or use any seal bearing University names
and marks.
15.3.1.4
Use By Other Voluntary University-Affiliated
Organizations
Voluntary groups comprised of University students, employees,
families and friends that are registered with the University may
refer to themselves as the “OIST Graduate University [name of
group]” but they may not use any other University names and
marks. Proposed graphics related to use of the term “OIST
Graduate University” by such voluntary groups must be
submitted to the Vice President for Communication and Public
Relations for approval (Chapter 16.3.1 [link: 16.3.1]).
15.3.2 Tax Considerations
There is potential for generating revenue by licensing University names
and marks; this may also give rise to tax consequences. All proposed
“business plans” involving use of University names and marks must be
reviewed and coordinated with the Vice President for Financial
Management [link: 2.4.5] and the Technology Licensing Section [link:
Chapter 14] prior to detailed development or implementation of such
plans.
15.3.3 Use in Fundraising
Without exception, all fundraising activities[link: 7], whether or not
names and marks are used, must be pursued through and coordinated
with the Office of the President. Additionally, permission to use the
University’s names and marks in fundraising requires approval by the
3
ch15_Name-Use-Endorsements-and-Use-of-University-Logo-and-Trademarks_20170413_en.cl

Vice President for Communication and Public Relations in order to
ensure, among other things, conformance with University style and
format conventions [link: 16.3.1].
15.3.4 Use in Partnerships and Affiliations
A partnership or affiliation that requires the use of the University’s
names and marks as a condition of the relationship (for example,
research contracts/grants and procurement contracts/agreements),
may be construed as an endorsement or be otherwise problematic.
Such agreements must be reviewed by the Vice President for Financial
Management [link: 2.4.5] and by the Vice President for Communication
and Public Relations [link: 2.4.5] prior to execution.
15.3.4.1 This is to be distinguished from use of the University’s
names and marks for outside academic and research-related
events in which the University is a participant, affiliate, or
sponsor. Such use is a normal adjunct to the University’s
academic and research endeavors and is ordinarily appropriate
so long as the University’s graphic and stylistic standards are
met (Chapter 16.3.1 [link: 16.3.1]).
15.3.5 Use in Political Campaigns
It is forbidden to use, directly or indirectly, any name and mark of the
University in political campaigns. Questions should be directed to the
office of theDean of the Faculty Affairs ] (for academic staff) or the
office of the President [link: 2.4.1] (administrative staff).
15.3.6 Use in Endorsements
University faculty and staff are not permitted to give endorsements (a
positive evaluative statement about a product or service) on behalf of
the University. Statements made by University personnel in their
official capacity may not in any way imply University preference for or
endorsement of a particular firm, organization, product, or service.
15.3.6.1 The Vice President for Communication and Public
Relations may grant permission to use the name of the
University, but not its marks, in a statement of fact concerning a
vendor relationship and/or work performed. Examples:
“OIST Graduate University has contracted with X Company
for vehicle fleet maintenance.”
or
“X has been awarded a contract for computer peripherals by
OIST Graduate University.”

4
ch15_Name-Use-Endorsements-and-Use-of-University-Logo-and-Trademarks_20170413_en.cl

Such statements may not in any way imply University preference
for or endorsement of a particular firm, organization, product, or
service.
Example of what may not be stated:
“OIST Graduate University has contracted with X Company
for vehicle fleet maintenance because X has the best
mechanics in Okinawa.”
15.3.6.2 Personal endorsements in University publications (print
or electronic) may be permissible, as long as the author makes it
clear that such statements are personal and not the position of
the University or any of its units, and as long as no personal gain
is realized from the endorsement.
15.3.6.3 Objective factual valuations of products or services (not
an endorsement) must be accompanied by the following
disclaimer:
“The OIST Graduate University does not sponsor or endorse
the products or services described.”
15.3.7 Use in Marketing, Movies, TV, Press Releases, etc.
When University names and marks, or images of the University, are
used in association with television or radio programs, videos, movies,
events, projects, magazine shoots, and similar activities, official
University involvement is likely to be inferred. Requests to use
photographs or other images of the University, or any of its names and
marks, in advertisements or marketing materials, or in press releases,
movies or television programs, must be immediately directed to the
Vice President for Communication and Public Relations (Chapter 16
[link: 16]).
15.3.8 Reporting Suspected Misuse or Infringement
Refer to Chapter 23, Misconduct & Whistleblower Protection [link: 23],
for guidance on reporting suspected misuse, infringement, or other
similar misconduct with regard to name use, endorsements, or use of
logo and trademarks.

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules & Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 17. Information Technology and Security
17.1 Policy
This policy is in place to ensure that OIST Information Technology Resources (IT
resources) are provisioned and used in an effective, efficient, prudent and
responsible manner [link: 21.3.2], in line with the missions of the University and
in compliance with relevant legal and contractual obligations. All users are
expected to be familiar with these policies, rules and procedures and consequences
of violation.
All University information is deemed to comprise University information assets.
The University owns and controls its information assets. Appropriate handling of
information assets is vital to the protection of OIST and its community, all users
are responsible in this regard.
Though the University takes reasonable security measures to protect the security
of its IT resources, the University does not guarantee absolute security nor privacy.
The University has the right to monitor any and all IT Resources and their usage,
including e-mail, without limitation. The University is responsible for taking any
measures necessary to ensure the security and integrity of its IT Resources. When
it becomes aware of violations of policy or law, either through routine system
administration activities or via incident notification, it is the responsibility of the
University to investigate as needed or directed, and take action to protect its
resources and/or to provide information relevant to an investigation.
OIST has an obligation to preserve Information Assets for archival and reporting
purposes. Additionally, upon direction from the President or General Counsel and
upon consent of Chief Information Officer (CIO) [link: 2.4.1.3] and Chief
Information Security Manager (CISM), Information Assets may sometimes be
preserved for prescribed periods of time for litigation or other legal purposes.
IT Resources are not to be used for personal or private purposes unrelated to the
mission of the University. However, incidental personal use is permitted so long as
such use does not interfere or conflict with the employee’s work responsibilities or
other obligations to the University, and does not generate additional direct cost to
the University. Users are responsible for the content of their personal
communications. The University accepts no responsibility or liability for
unauthorized use of its IT resources in a manner which does not comply with policy
or law.
17.2 General Considerations

1
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

17.2.1 Scope
These policies, rules and procedures are applicable to all users. In particular,
all users are subject to the requirements as set out under “User’s Rights and
Responsibilities” and the “OIST Graduate University IT Acceptable Use
Policy”.
In accessing, storing or transmitting University Information all IT Assets
become subject to these policies. This includes personal devices, devices
wholly or partially owned by the University, and devices from external
organizations or entities.
17.2.2 Ownership of Information Assets
The University owns and controls its information assets. The University
assigns responsibility for managing and protecting its Information Assets,
and ensuring compliance with policy and law, to Information Asset
Managers and Information Asset Administrators.
Within research units the Faculty serves as Information Asset Manager, and
may assign the Information Asset Administrator role to a unit member.
Ensuring appropriate management and security schemes for unpublished
research data is the prerogative of the faculty, whom must also take into
account any pre-existing official agreements that would require additional
security or protection of information assets. Note that a primary copy of all
research data should remain on OIST managed repositories at all times.
Within Divisions the Vice-President services as Information Asset Manager,
and may assign the Information Asset Administrator role to one or more
Section members.
Corporate Documents and Personal Information are a sub-set of
Information Assets, but have additional legal and policy requirements, such
as “Public Document Policy Act” and “Law concerning Access to Personal
Information Held by Independent Administrative Institutions”, associated
with their handling. These requirements as well as separate management
and administration roles are detailed here [link: 12].
Intellectual property, institutional agreements, or other contractual
requirements upon the University may modify the ownership and treatment
of information assets, these are covered under PRP Chapter 4 and Chapter
14.
17.2.3 Principles of Information Technology Management
Wherever possible University IT resources are to be provisioned in
alignment with industry best practice. To this end the ITSM framework is
employed to provide a structure in which to describe and specify IT services.
2
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

Core to the ITSM framework is the concept of a Service Level Agreement
(SLA), which acts to provide clear expectations in the scope, timeliness and
quality of IT services between IT Division and the University. This SLA must
be drafted in conjunction with stake holders from all areas of the University.
This SLA must be deliberated upon and approved by stake holders from all
areas of the University, via the IT Service and Support Committee.
17.2.4 Principles of Information Security
The purpose of information security is to protect Information Assets from
unauthorized access or damage, and ensure accordance with all applicable
laws, regulations and compliance requirements [link: 17.8.8].
17.2.5 Further Policies Rules and Procedures
Research units, Divisions or Sections within the University may impose
additional conditions of use upon IT Resources or facilities under their
control. Such conditions must be consistent with this overall policy. They
may provide additional detail, guidelines or greater restrictions. They may
not provide lesser restrictions.
17.2.6 Communications and Public Relations
Other standards and rules developed by the Vice President for
Communication and Public Relations apply to use of University IT with
regard to e-mail, websites, and social media; compliance with those
standards and rules is mandatory.
17.2.7 Students
Students should refer to the Graduate School Handbook in addition to
familiarizing themselves with this chapter.
17.2.8 General Conduct
Beyond the policies and procedures regarding usage of the IT Resources as
detailed herein, all users are expected to exercise sound judgment, and in
situations where policy or procedure is unclear are expected to contact IT
Division or the relevant party to seek clarification.
17.2.9 Compliance
Any breach of information security, or misuse of IT Resources is regarded
as serious. Breaches may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal and legal action.
17.3 Rules
3
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

17.3.1 Authorization and Access
All access to, and usage of IT resources must be appropriately requested,
approved, registered and audited. A user is defined as any individual or
entity granted access to OIST information assets to a level above public
classification [link: 17.8.9], or to IT resources above that available to the
general public.
Users are responsible for protecting their account information by ensuring
that their login, password and other access credentials remain secure at all
times. The sharing of account information or passwords is not permitted,
and may only be known to, and used by the individual assigned them.
In using these resources, users agree to abide by all relevant University
policies, rules, procedures and applicable law. Users must acknowledge this
understanding by reading and signing the OIST Graduate University
Acceptable Use Policy, via physical signature or digital equivalent.
17.3.1.1 Account Creation
User accounts will be created via the following process:
⚫ Onboarding into the University via the process relevant to the
user’s classification, resulting in registration into the OIST
Identity Management System
⚫ Acknowledgement by signature (or digital equivalent) of the OIST

report

17.3.2 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
The University does not require personnel to use their personal resources
to conduct University business.
Within the administration, the usage of personal IT assets to conduct OIST
business is permitted only with the authorization of IT Division.
Within research units, the faculty may choose to permit the use of BYOD
devices, and users may elect to use their own resources accordingly, though
at no time should any user be compelled to do so. The University accepts no
responsibility or liability for damage to BYOD devices. The faculty and asset
owner are accountable for any and all issues arising from the usage of such
personal assets.
Note that in connecting a personal IT asset to the OIST network (BYOD), or
using a personal asset to store or transmit University Information, the asset
is then subject to this policy and must comply with all OIST requirements.
In the case of BYOD devices, eligibility to store OIST information assets may
vary. Users are required to ensure that OIST information assets, the devices
5
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

used to access them, and the mode of access conform to OIST information
classification and device eligibility criteria.
17.3.3 Connecting to the OIST Network
The OIST network is an essential research resource, maintaining its
availability and security is vital to the function of the University and is the
responsibility of all users. All IT assets connecting to the OIST network must
do so via OIST network authentication, uniquely identifying the active user.
Users may only connect OIST IT assets for which they have authorization to
use to the OIST network, and only for their own use. The connection of
assets to the OIST network for the use of other users, or third parties is
strictly prohibited.
Where network authentication poses a barrier to research or OIST business,
users must contact IT Division to seek an exception. The connection of any
devices that would bypass or mitigate network authentication, or enable
other devices to do so, is strictly prohibited.
In order to ensure the security and stability of the OIST network, the
connection of network devices, such as switches, routers or hubs without
the authorization of IT Division is strictly prohibited. The usage of any
wireless networks other than those provided by IT Division within OIST
facilities without prior permission of IT Division is not permitted. Any
unauthorized devices found to be connected to the OIST network, or
providing wireless networking within OIST facilities may be disconnected
without notice.
17.3.4 Procurement, Outsourcing and IT Assets
OIST IT Asset purchases must be fit for purpose. They must also be
procured, audited, re-used and disposed of appropriately. In addition to
University procurement policy, rules and procedures [link: 28], the
purchase of IT Assets are also subject to the rules herein.
Regardless of procurement path or budget, all IT assets procured, donated
to or otherwise received by OIST must be physically inspected by IT Division
staff upon receipt. This inspection will include indelible asset marking
(exceptions to which must be approved by CIO), and registration into the
Configuration Management Database (CMDB) to allow for the efficient
tracking and auditing of assets.
Exemptions may exist where the IT asset is an integral part of a larger
6
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

research device or apparatus, i.e. a control PC bundled with a microscope.
In this case the party receiving the asset is to coordinate with IT Division.
Consultation with IT Division is required before the purchase of any IT asset
intended to be housed in IT Division facilities (server rooms, network
spaces etc.) [link: 17.3.30].
17.3.4.1 Procurement of IT Assets within the Administration
Within the administration, including the Research Support Division,
the procurement or upgrade of any IT asset (including any software
procurement with a price above a 10,000yen) must be conducted via
IT Division. This is to ensure standardization where applicable, and
to ensure the devices are purchased in an efficient fashion. The
procedure for requesting the purchase or upgrade of an IT device
within the administration is detailed at PRP 17.5.1.
All IT assets within the administration fall under control of the IT
Division, and are subject to this policy regardless of how they were
acquired or funds used to purchase them.
17.3.4.2 Procurement of IT Assets within Research Units
Research units are strongly encouraged to consult with IT Division
before purchasing any IT asset. Where the research unit elects to
purchase without consultation, the level of support IT Division can
deliver to the IT asset may be limited. Connectivity with OIST
networks is not guaranteed in this case. The support levels available
to the various device categories are detailed in the SLA. The
procurement process for IT assets within research units is covered
under PRP 17.5.3.
IT assets to be procured as part of a larger research equipment
purchase, or to be attached to research equipment should be
specified with thought to reliability and performance. The reliability
of these assets has substantial impact on the productivity of critical
research equipment. Guidelines for specifying these purchases are
part of the process for procurement of IT assets within research units
[link: 17.5.3].
17.3.4.3 Procurement of IT Assets via Corporate Credit Card
The purchase of IT assets using corporate credit card (P-Card) is
restricted, please see PRP 26.3.7. The purchase of IT assets from
7
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

online vendors can only be conducted via IT Division.
17.3.4.4 IT Asset Tracking
All IT assets which are wholly or partially owned by the university are
to have the OIST asset tracking agent installed. This agent allows for
the dynamic audit of IT assets, resulting in substantial savings in
costs and personnel time during mandatory yearly asset audits. This
requirement is mandatory for all assets in the administration, and
strongly advised for assets within research units.
17.3.4.5 IT Asset Transfer
The transfer of usage or ownership of any IT device, including
between users, sections or research units, must be conducted via IT
Division. In this way the asset register and CMDB is kept up to date,
and data in the devices is securely erased prior to transfer to prevent
breaches in security or personal information protection. The process
for transferring an asset between users or sections and units is
described at PRP 17.5.5.
17.3.4.6 IT Assets Outside of OIST Premises
Where any IT asset is to be taken off-site, including for the purposes
of business trips or working from home, prior authorization must be

ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

users. Users are encouraged to use these software, but must respect
copyright law and licensing restrictions at all times.
Software titles held by IT Division are in general only eligible for installation
onto IT assets wholly owned by the University, users must not install
software onto an IT asset without first confirming the IT asset is eligible.
Details of available software and licensing restrictions are covered as part
of the software catalog.
Within the administration the use of software outside the software catalog
is not permitted. Where additional software is required, users must contact
IT Division to request an addition to the catalog.
Within research units the use of software outside the software catalog is
permitted, though consideration must be given to security. In using
software outside the software catalog users should:
⚫ Ensure the software has been downloaded from known reputable sources,
such as the official website
⚫ Ensure security patches are applied
17.3.8.1 Licensed or commercial software

four classifications listed below, based upon determined value,
confidentiality, integrity and availability. Where information assets with
10
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

different levels of classification are grouped together, the highest
classification shall be applied.
Further guidance on the handling of information assets is detailed under
PRP 17.8.9 “information classification and device eligibility”.
17.3.9.1 Public
Information assets assigned the ‘Public’ classification should either
be by their nature a matter of public record, or have been deemed
safe to be publicly disclosed or to provide positive or neutral impact
to OIST business, reputation or personnel.
17.3.9.2 Internal
Information assets to be assigned the ‘Internal’ classification are
those for which disclosure is not appropriate, and may result in a
moderate negative impact to OIST business, reputation or personnel.
These assets are to be made accessible to OIST users on a need to
know basis. Unpublished research data or papers are in general
deemed to fall under this classification.
Third parties may be granted access to information assets with an
‘Internal’ classification where a business need exists.
This classification should be regarded as the default for OIST
information assets.
17.3.9.3 Confidential
Information assets assigned the ‘Confidential’ classification are those
for which disclosure would result in significant negative impact to
OIST business, reputation or personnel. This classification includes
information assets subject to protection under law or government
regulation, including but not limited to personal information such as
My Number, credit card and passport information. These assets are
to be made accessible only to small restricted groups of users by
Information Asset Managers, on a need to know basis. Access is to be
regularly audited.
17.3.9.4 Critical
Information assets assigned the ‘Critical’ classification are those for
which disclosure would result in severe negative impact to OIST
business, reputation or personnel. Access to ’Critical’ information
assets shall be granted only to small, tightly restricted groups of
11
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

authorized users. The strict system access and data access controls
must
be
applied,
and
access
audited
regularly.
Information assets can only be assigned the ’Critical’ classification
upon approval by the Provost or the Chief Operating Officer (COO).
17.3.10 Protection of Information Assets
In ensuring the basic protection of OIST information assets, users must
handle Information Assets in a manner appropriate to the information
classification they have been assigned. The security level of the devices used
to access information assets and the mode of access must be commensurate
with the sensitivity of the asset and conform to OIST information
classification and device eligibility criteria.
OIST information assets are to be used for business purposes only, users
shall not use OIST information assets for any purpose other than the task
for which they are intended. Access to Information Assets must be granted
on a “need to know” basis, where required for a user to complete their duties,
and in line with business needs.
The protection of personal information is further restricted by the
regulations as detailed in [link: 12.3.8]. All users which will deal with
personal information must familiarize themselves with, and remain abreast
of changes to these rules.
17.3.11 Information Security
Compliance with information security policy is vital to ensuring the security
of OIST information assets, and is the responsibility of all users. In
protecting the university and its information assets users must comply with
the rules herein when creating, processing or storing information.
In supporting the CISM to protect the interests of the University, systems
administrators shall comply with all rules detailed herein, and comply
promptly with directives from the CISM when given.
17.3.12 Information Security Incident Response
Information security incidents are defined as a single or series of unwanted
events that compromise (or are likely to compromise) the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of OIST Information assets and/or breach OIST rule
or Japanese law.
Security Incident Response differs from Data Forensics in that it is triggered
12
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

by notifications or events, and that only the result of the investigation is
disclosed beyond the IT personnel tasked with investigating it, no data is
disclosed. The CIO and CISM are responsible for investigating security
incidents, and to take all necessary actions in order to protect OIST and its
resources and/or to provide information relevant to an investigation. In this
regard the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security
Manager (CISM) and Networking and Telecommunications Manager
(NTM) have specific rights and responsibilities.
Any user who becomes aware of an information security incident must
immediately contact CIO and CISM via e-mail cio@oist.jp cism@oist.jp), or
by phone (see the OIST directory, https://directory.oist.jp).
Please see the Information Security Incident Response Procedures for more
details.
17.3.13 Data Forensics
Data forensics is the practice of identifying, extracting and examining data
in response to incidents. This may include data held in on IT assets, e-mail,
SharePoint, or any other digital repositories.
Data forensics are routinely performed after consultation with and consent
from the owner of the data. In cases where the data owner does not consent,
or where legal or other requirements prevent seeking the consent of the data
owner, the approval of the President is required.
The incidents triggering data forensics, along with the data and IT assets
involved, are often sensitive or confidential in nature. The purpose of the
Data Forensics Procedure is to ensure that data forensics activities are
conducted appropriately. The procedure requires that appropriate
approvals take place, that the privileges of the parties involved are
segregated, and that access to data is limited to only that relevant to the
incident.
Request
The data forensics investigation request form is completed by the individual
tasked with performing the examination of the data (the investigator), or
responsible for the transfer of custody of the data in cases involving the
police. The request for details;
⚫ The reasoning behind the request
⚫ The data to be targeted as part of the request
13
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

⚫ The duration for which access to the data will be required
Approval
The form must be approved by one of the Vice-Presidents, Deans or General
Counsel, and either the data owner or the President.
Verification
The CIO or delegated representative will receive the request and verify that
appropriate approvals have been given. They will then appoint a member of
IT to extract the relevant data.
Extraction
The member of IT Division performing the investigation will extract a data
to an encrypted, dedicated temporary PC, and give custody to the CIO or
delegated representative.
Access
The CIO or delegated representative will then give custody of the temporary
PC and associated access credentials to the investigator.
Deletion
Once the access duration period has expired, the CIO will ensure the
temporary PC is returned and all extracted data is securely erased.
Reporting
The CIO will prepare and send a final report to the President which describe
the result of the data forensics activity, and confirms the date of deletion of
the data extracted.
Filing
The request form will be filed within IT, along with the final report.
Responses to IT security incidents are not covered here, and are instead
covered under PRP 17.3.12, Information Security Incident Response.
17.3.14 IT Asset Removal
IT Asset Removal is the temporary removal and retention of an IT asset in
response to an incident. This may include the removal and retention of
laptops, desktops, mobile drives or any other IT asset. IT assets are often
critical to business functions, as such their removal is not routine, and must
be appropriately requested and approved as described below.
14
ch17_information-technology-&-security_en_20181221_cl

IT assets can be removed and retained upon request by of one of the
President, General Counsel, Provost, COO, Dean of Research, or Dean of
Faculty Affairs, with the concurrence of the CIO. The CIO will notify the
asset owner of the device removal, and delegate a member of IT Division to
remove and retain the IT asset within secure IT facilities. The removal of the
IT asset may precede the notification to the asset owner where legal or other
requirements prevent advance notification.
Access to data held on IT assets, including those that have been removed
and retained, is subject to the Data Forensics Procedure.
Responses to IT security incidents are not covered here, and are instead
covered under PRP 17.3.12, Information Security Incident Response.
17.3.15 Labeling
Information assets must have their document classification clearly marked
on the cover page, footer, header or watermark regardless of format.

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules & Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 18. Telecommunications Services and Devices
18.1 Policy
The OIST Graduate University (the University) aims to provide
telecommunications services (including mobile phone services) to the
University researchers and employees in a manner which is fair, simple,
accountable and financially responsible. The University allocates
telecommunications devices where appropriate in order to;
• Avoid excessive charges to the individual, generated where the
University business must be conducted via a telecommunications
device.
• Prevent the conduct of the University business via a personal
telecommunications device where inappropriate.
• Ensure the individual has the capacity to act in emergency situations
where tasked with doing so.
This policy applies all telecommunications services and devices regardless of
the country of purchase, telecommunications carrier, or if the device has an
associated ongoing service contract.
All the University telecommunications devices, including mobile phones, are
managed by the University IT Division under centralized contracts. These
centralized contracts result in significant cost benefits for the University; for
example, calls from one University mobile phone to another incur no charges.
18.2

General Considerations
18.2.1 It is anticipated that all University users will have a personal
telecommunications device in addition to the University provided
device.
18.2.2 University provided telecommunications devices are intended to
be used for business purposes only.
18.2.3 Limited personal use of telecommunication devices by President
[link: 2.4.1], Auditors [link: 2.4.4], Senior Level Executive [link:

1
ch18_Telecommunications-Services-and-Devices_20170816_en_cl

30.2.2.1.1] and Faculty Member [link: 30.2.2.1.2] (hereinafter
“Executive Members”) is permitted.
18.2.3.1 Where the monthly charges for the device exceed the
threshold [link: 18.3.3], Executive Members will be
presented with 3 months of usage data, and asked to
identify the personal usage component. This personal
usage component will be used to create a fixed
percentage monthly charge for personal usage. Ongoing
monthly charges for the device will be monitored by IT
Division, and where average monthly charges for the
device increase or decrease markedly, the above process
will be repeated to calculate an updated fixed
percentage monthly charge for personal usage.
18.2.4 There are several classes of telecommunications devices, which
vary in cost to the University. Please see the list of standard
University provided telecommunication devices [link:].
18.2.4.1 The University standard devices are selected based on
functionality. Where a newer device does not present a
benefit to the University business over a standard
device, the device will not be provided regardless of
personal preference.
18.2.4.2 The class of device provided will be commensurate with
the business requirement. For example, lower cost
devices such as flip-phones will be allocated where a
more advanced device is not required.
18.2.5 Ownership and control of University IT devices, including
telecommunications devices, is described in the PRP 17.2.1 [link:
17.2.1].
18.2.6 In general, the University funding for overseas purchase of IT and
telecommunications services and devices is not permitted.
Exceptions may be considered where specific University business
is shown to require a local device overseas, and where the usage
will be solely for that purposes. In general, internet chat and
video conferencing services should be used for international
communications.
18.2.7 Rental telecommunications devices are available from the IT
Division, and rental of these devices is preferred over allocation to
an individual where the requirement is temporary in nature.

2
ch18_Telecommunications-Services-and-Devices_20170816_en_cl

18.2.8 Sections and units can also apply for locally shared
telecommunications devices. These devices would be managed at
the section or unit level, and allocated for specific functions, such
as new employees, visiting researchers etc.
18.2.8.1 Sections and units are to elect a staff member who will
be responsible for the management and allocation of
any locally shared telecommunications devices.

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules, & Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 22 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest and
Commitment
22.1 Policy.
In addition to their duties as faculty, academic and administrative staff, and the
University Officers and other Senior Level Executives (collectively referred to
as “employees” in this chapter) of OIST Graduate University (hereinafter “the
University”) often serve on external committees, commissions, panels, and
boards of directors. The more entrepreneurial among them engage in private
consulting or other business activity. University employees also support a
variety of social, community, and political causes. Moreover, in the course of
their official duties, employees develop relationships with vendors, research
sponsors, donors, and others who contribute to or support the University.
It is the policy of the University to encourage all of these endeavors and
relationships. However, care must be taken to ensure that none gives rise to
conflicts of commitment or interest. The matters covered in this policy are of
great importance to the University. Each member of the University community
has a responsibility to avoid and prevent conflicts of interest and to take steps
to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
Responsibility for review and ultimate resolution of conflict of interest matters
is vested in the Chief Operating Officer (hereinafter “COO); a four-person
panel, comprised of University General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer
(hereinafter “CCO”), and two faculty members appointed by the Dean of Faculty
Affairs.(known as the “Conflict of Interest Review Panel”) will assess the facts
and report their findings and recommendation to the COO for decision. As a
general rule, conflicts of interest determinations are based on what potential
outcomes are made possible by the situation, rather than on the character,
intent, or actions of the employee. However, a finding that an employee
willfully ignored or intentionally violated the policies and rules of Chapter 22
requires that the employee be subjected to disciplinary action including
significant sanction or possible termination of employment. See also
Misconduct & Whistleblower Protection.
The following policies (and related rules and procedures) should guide all
University employees as they carry out their work at the University.
22.1.1 Conflict of Commitment
1
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

Because faculty and other University employees owe a duty of primary
commitment to the University and its missions, it is the policy of the
University that the external activities and engagements of employees
may not demand so much of their time, effort, or attention that their
ability to satisfy their obligations to the University is adversely affected.
(Chapter 22.8.1)
22.1.2 Institutional Conflict of Interest
University research, teaching, outreach, and other activities must not be
compromised or be perceived as biased by institutional relationships
with external entities. The existence (or appearance) of such conflicts
can lead to actual bias, or suspicion about possible bias, in the review or
conduct of the University’s business activities. It is the policy of the
University that situations that may give rise to such conflicts be disclosed,
evaluated, and discontinued if a conflict interest or commitment is
present. This is necessary to prevent decisions, choices or actions that
are incongruent with the missions, obligations, or values of the
University. (Chapter 22.8.5)
22.1.3 Individual Conflict of Interest
When there is a divergence between an individual's private interests and
his or her professional obligations to the University, such that an
independent observer might reasonably question whether the
individual's professional actions or decisions are determined by
considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise, an Individual
Conflict of Interest arises. It is the policy of the University that situations
that might create conflicts be disclosed to and evaluated by the
appropriate office as soon as they are known. If an actual or perceived
conflict of interest or commitment is found, the relationship or activity
must be discontinued. (Chapter 22.8.4)
22.1.3.1 Employing Related Parties
It is the policy of the University to seek for its faculty the best
possible teachers and scholars who are judged to be so in an
international search preceding each appointment (Chapter 3).
Similarly, it is the policy of the University for its academic and
administrative staff the best qualified persons for the position
through competitive selection process (Chapter 31.3.2). There are
no bars to the appointment of “related parties”, such as
immediate family members, business partners, and close
personal friends, to any University position, so long as each meets
the relevant standard for appointment. However, no faculty
member, or any other University employee shall vote, make
recommendations, or in any other way participate in the decision
2
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

of any matter which may directly affect the appointment,
reappointment, tenure (for a faculty member), promotion, salary,
or other status or interest of a related party, nor shall he or she
supervise a related party.
22.1.3.2 Doing Business with Related Parties
University employees must not conduct University business with
related parties such as immediate family members, business
partners, and close personal friends. University employees must
not conduct University business with an entity in which a related
party has a significant interest. University employees must not
lease or purchase, on behalf of the University, real property in
which a related party holds an ownership interest.
22.1.3.3
Individual Conflict of Interest Concerning Student
Admission
Faculty members who involve in student admission may have a
conflict of interest. The policy, rules and procedures for such
cases are provided by the Chapter 5, Graduate School Handbook
(Chapter 5.13.1.6).
22.1.4 Consulting and Other Business, Commercial or
Financial Relationships
The University believes that it is good and useful for faculty and other
professional employees to deploy their expertise through
entrepreneurial activity, such as providing consulting or other services
to individuals, business entities, other universities, and the community.
However, employees must be alert to the fact that implicit in activities of
a commercial nature are conflicts of interest arising from access to
confidential information (the University’s and the commercial entity’s)
and the possible ability to influence pertinent decisions of either entity.
It is the policy of the University that such situations be disclosed to and
evaluated by the appropriate office as soon as they are known. If an
actual or perceived conflict of interest or commitment is found, the
relationship or activity must be discontinued.
22.1.4.1 Employees may not engage in any outside business if it
interferes with their responsibilities to the University. Faculty are
generally granted leave to pursue such outside work (Chapter 3).
Other employees are required to pursue such work outside their
normal working hours or by using accrued leave/vacation
(Chapter 33) with prior approval in accordance with OIST Rules
for External Professional Activities.
22.1.5 External Professional Activities
3
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

It is the policy of the University to encourage its employees to contribute
to society at large by serving on committees, commissions, advisory
boards, boards of directors, task forces and other similar associations. It
is also the policy of the University to require disclosure of, and to review,
all such external engagements in order to detect and avoid potential
conflicts of commitment or interest and other similar concerns,
including the involvement of University resources in otherwise personal
activities.
22.1.6 Political Activity
Although the University encourages its employees at all levels to
participate in the full spectrum of permissible political activities, both
locally and nationally, it is University policy that no University
endorsement may be implied or asserted by its employees when so doing
(Chapter 15). Similarly, it is the policy of the University to forbid use of
University resources, including their paid work time or the paid work
time of other University employees, to support personal political activity
(Chapter 21). Attention must be given also to the Policy on Conflict of
Commitment to ensure that outside political activity does not demand
so much of an employee’s time, effort, or attention that their ability to
satisfy their obligations to the University is adversely affected.
22.1.6.1 Permissible Political Activities
Campaigning for Public Office. Although prior approval is not
required, it is the policy of the University that its employees
contemplating candidacy for elective political office or
appointment to public office should contact their responsible
administrator/supervisor to discuss potential conflicts and work
impact.
22.1.6.2 Prohibited & Restricted Political Activities
It is the policy of the University that its employees do not
influence inappropriately any decisions by national and local
government officials, and that its employees refrain from conduct
creating even an appearance of trying to influence
inappropriately any decisions by national and local government
officials.
22.2 Examples of Conflicts of Interest
It is essential that all University employees recognize, disclose, and avoid all
conflicts of interest and commitment. Although the variations are endless, here
are examples of how conflicts of interest may arise:
22.2.1 Major Gifts from Commercial Sponsors.
4
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

Significant gifts to the University from a commercial sponsor of research
may raise questions about the influence of the company on the
University’s research programs and how they are managed. Other similar
concerns arise when individual companies sponsor research or provide
significant consulting income to a significant number of faculty members.
22.2.1.1 Gifts, or promise of gifts, in exchange for favorable terms
on a technology license, or first look at IP create a conflict of
interest.
22.2.1.2
Alumni venture funds that provide for a portion of
revenue to be “contributed” to the University must be carefully
scrutinized for creating conflict of interest conditions – whether
real or perceived.
22.2.2 Procurement of Goods and Services from Entities in
which the University has a Financial Interest.
Purchasing goods and services from entities that sponsor research at the
University, or who are licensees of University technology, or who make
significant contributions to University activities and endeavors, can
sometimes give rise to a conflict of interest situation; these should be
carefully scrutinized and evaluated; if it is determined to proceed, a
written justification should be obtained.
22.2.3 Acceptance of Gifts & Favors from Others
Those doing business with the University, or wishing to do business with
the University, may offer gifts (any item of personal benefit to the
recipient) to University employees. These may range from the offer of a
box of candy to paying for the employee’s dinner to an all-expenses-paid
trip to a resort (to give a “talk”). Exorbitant honoraria, extremely
generous speaker’s fees, luxury travel and accommodations, gifts of
expensive equipment, or other lavish treatment may be offered by
research sponsors and by vendors, and the items offered are often
characterized as “in support of” the employee’s University activities. All
such favors create impermissible conflicts of interest.
However, we may accept “promotional goods or commemoratives to be
widely distributed” such as pocket tissues, calendar, memo-booklet,
ballpoint pen free sample of research materials which are deemed
reasonable under normal social conventions.
22.2.3.1 You may accept gifts & favors of not more than 5,000 yen
from universities or institutions which you do not have any
conflict of interests with, without filing a report; however, if you
accept gifts & favors from universities or institutions that exceed
5
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

5,000 yen, you must submit a Report of Gifts & Favors to CCO.
22.2.4 Financial Interests Related to Licensing of University
Technology.
The University has an active program to license its inventions to
commercial entities (Chapter 14). Under these licenses the University
typically acquires a Financial Interest in successfully developed products
and, sometimes, in the developing entity itself. These Financial Interests
can be of concern when they may appear to influence decisions about the
conduct of research, teaching or other activities. For example, even where
individual investigators do not have a personal stake, knowledge that the
University stands to gain financially from successful development of a
licensed technology can influence the direction of related research, the
objectivity of research, the dissemination of results and the allocation of
University resources among competing projects. The potential for conflict
increases where the licensee sponsors research at the University. In such
situations, the University’s Financial Interests under the license may
appear to affect decisions concerning the terms or conduct of the
sponsored research.
22.2.4.1 Equity Interests in Start-up Companies. In licenses to
start-up companies the University may accept equity in lieu of
licensing fees or in exchange for reduced royalties. From a
financial viewpoint, the potential gain from holding equity may
far exceed the potential return from a royalty-only license. The
potential for significant gain, and the possibility that it may be
realized long before any product comes to market, increases the
possibility that such an equity interest may influence or may
appear to influence University decisions about research that could
affect the value of the University’s equity position. Such
arrangements must be fully disclosed and must be carefully
scrutinized to ensure that research decisions are not influenced by
the University’s potential for realizing financial gain.
22.2.4.2 University employees hired specifically to encourage
faculty start-ups (for example, to seek broker financial
relationships with fledgling enterprises) create special exposure
for universities and the perception of Institutional Conflicts of
Interest. It is critical that these activities be reported and
assiduously monitored to prevent conflicts of interest.
22.2.5 Master Agreements with a Commercial Sponsor.
Based on known research strengths, private sector entities may offer longterm funding support for research conducted within specific disciplines.
6
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

This type of support, often governed by a master agreement, may attempt
to give special preferences to the sponsoring entity. Such agreements must
be carefully reviewed by those not involved in the carrying out of the
agreement in order to prevent any inappropriate preference or other
conflict of interest.
22.2.6 Advisory Committees and Collaborative Arrangements
with Commercial Entities.
Participation in collaborative agreements, advisory committees, research
review panels and similar associations often provides special access to
research results. These arrangements, and the contracts or agreements
that support them, must be scrutinized to ensure that they do not include
provisions that will give rise to, or create the appearance of, conflicts.
22.2.7 Research Involving the Use of Human Subjects.
The University has special responsibilities to participants in human
subjects research and must ensure that its financial relationships do not
compromise its primary obligations to them. For this reason, the research
must be subjected to close scrutiny to prevent even the appearance of a
conflict of interest. Please refer to Chapter 13 for other matters concerning
research involving the use of human subjects.
22.2.8 Access to Closely-Held Information.
Councilors and Governors and other employees, in the course of meeting
their obligations and duties to the University, may get early knowledge of
new technologies and other significant developments. Some of these same
members may hold a management role or board seat on companies’ Board
of Directors that are looking to contribute to major developments, to
license technology, or to sponsor research at the University. Use of such
information for private inurement gives rise to ethical questions and a
conflict of interest. Use for personal purposes of information received as
an employee of the University is forbidden.
22.3 Rules
All those working for, or on behalf of, the University must conduct their affairs
so as to avoid conflicts of commitment and interest, or even the appearance of
such conflicts.
22.3.1 Annual Disclosure
To facilitate evaluation of situations that may give rise to conflicts of
interest, formal written disclosure of external activities and
commitments is required of all employees each year. All University
employees must timely complete and submit an annual “Conflicts of
Interest Disclosure Form for External Activities” to the COO.
7
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

22.3.2 Immediate Disclosure Requirement. If a situation raising
questions of conflict of commitment or interest arises after submission
of the annual disclosure, those involved must immediately bring the
situation to the attention of designated personnel in the Compliance
Section (University Officers and Senior Level Executives), the Faculty
Affairs Office (faculty and academic staff), or Compliance Section (other
employees).
22.3.3 Additional Special Disclosures Required of Faculty and
Academic Staff
22.3.3.1 Faculty and Academic Staff must foster the open and
timely exchange of results of scholarly activities, informing
students and colleagues about outside obligations that might
influence the free exchange of scholarly information.
22.3.3.2 Faculty and Academic Staff must disclose on a timely
basis the creation or discovery of all potentially patentable
inventions created or discovered in the course of their University
activities or with more than incidental use of University
resources. Ownership of such inventions must be assigned to the
University regardless of the source of funding. The inventor must
share in royalties earned.
22.3.3.3 In addition to disclosure to the Faculty Affairs Office,
Faculty and Academic Staff must disclose in writing to their
supervisor, or to the principal investigator on their research,
whether they (or Related Parties) have consulting arrangements,
significant Financial Interests, or employment in an outside
entity which provides funding to the University or is involved in
procurement or technology licensing relationships with the
University.
22.3.3.4 In any situations in which the objectivity of a faculty
member or Academic Staff could reasonably be questioned as
subject to a Conflict of Interest, the affected employee must
contact the Faculty Affairs Office for review and determination of
appropriate actions.
22.3.4 Political Activity
University employees may not use the University’s names or marks
(Chapter 15), must not imply University endorsement, and may not use
any University resources in political activity or in individual campaigns
8
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

for office or in political literature. Employees campaigning or
fundraising for or holding public office must comply with University
policies regarding use of University resources (equipment, services,
facilities, property, and their or other employees’ paid work time).
22.3.4.1 Campaigning for Public Office. Discussion with a
supervisor is required if the duties of a campaign or the holding
of an office would seriously interfere or conflict with the
fulfillment of the employee’s University responsibilities,
including hours of work. The discussion should focus on (1) the
degree to which the individual would be absent from work and/or
the activities related to the employee’s candidacy would interfere
with the performance of his or their regular duties; (2) whether
temporary suspension of some portion of the employee's
responsibilities can be reasonably accommodated without
imposing a significant resource burden on the employee's
division/office or research unit; and (3) how the absence might be
most effectively accommodated.
22.3.5 Related Parties
22.3.5.1
University employees may not vote, make
recommendations, or in any other way participate in the decision
of any matter which may directly affect the appointment,
reappointment, tenure (for a faculty member), promotion, salary,
or other status or interest of related parties and may not supervise
related parties.
22.3.5.2 University employees may not conduct University
business with vendors owned or operated by a related party.
22.3.5.3 University employees may not conduct University
business with an entity in which a significant interest is held or
owned by a related party.
22.3.5.4 The University may not lease or purchase real property
owned by a University employee or by a member of that
employee’s related party.
22.3.6 Gratuities and Favors
University employees may not accept gifts, trips, meals, or other similar
blandishments and inducements from those doing business, or wishing
to do business, with the University at any level and to any degree. This
prohibition affects sponsors of research as well as vendors.

22.8 Definitions
22.8.1 Conflict of Commitment
If the external activities and engagements of employees demand or
consume so much of their time, effort, or attention that their ability to
satisfy their obligations to the University is adversely affected, a Conflict
of Commitment exists.
22.8.2 Financial Interest
Financial Interest is an actual or foreseeable nontrivial financial benefit
resulting from a decision.
22.8.3 Gift
For purposes of this chapter, a “gift” is any gratuity, favor, discount,
entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance, service, training,
transportation, lodging, meals, or other item that constitutes a personal
benefit to the recipient, which is offered/given by anyone doing business
with the University or desiring to do business with the University,
12
ch22_avoiding-conflict-of-interests-&-commitment_en_20180817_cl

including sponsors of research. A gift to a family member of a University
official or a gift to any other individual based on that individual's
relationship with a University official, may be considered a “gift” for
purposes of this chapter if it is given with the knowledge and
acquiescence of the University employee and if the University employee
has reason to believe the gift was given because of the recipient's
University status. The word “gift” as used in this Chapter does not
include any gift (contribution, donation, bequest) made to the University
as described in Chapter 7, Fundraising.
22.8.4 Individual Conflict of Interest
When there is a divergence between an individual's private interests and
his or her professional obligations to the University, such that an
independent observer might reasonably question whether the
individual's professional actions or decisions are determined by
considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise, there is an
Individual Conflict of Interest. An individual conflict of interest depends
on the situation, and not on the character or actions of the individual.
22.8.5 Institutional Conflicts of Interest
An Institutional Conflict of Interest may occur when the University, any
of its University Officers, Senior Level Executives, members of the Board
of Governors, or a graduate school, division, or other sub-unit, or an
affiliated foundation or organization, has an external relationship with
or Financial Interest in an entity that itself has a Financial Interest in
University projects, research, or business transactions. University
Officers, Senior Level Executives or members of the Boards of Governors
may also have conflicts when they serve on the boards of (or otherwise
have an official relationship with) organizations that have significant
commercial transactions with the University. The existence (or
appearance) of such conflicts can lead to actual bias, or suspicion about
possible bias, in the review or conduct of research at the University. If
they are not evaluated or managed, they may result in choices or actions
that are incongruent with the missions, obligations, or the values of the
University.
22.8.6 Related Parties
For the purpose of this policy and chapter, “related parties” include, but
are not limited to, an employee’s immediate family members (parents,
siblings, spouses, children, other relatives within third degree of
kinship), persons living in the same the home/residence as the employee,
persons with whom the employee has a close personal friendship, and
persons with whom the employee has a business partnership or
association.

23.2.1.2 A report of a suspected misconduct made by anyone shall
be in good faith, based on objective and rational grounds. A
groundless report for defaming the respondent or that is driven by
bad faith (which means a will solely directed to causing a damage on
the respondent, such as for causing harm to the respondent or for
obstructing the research carried out by the respondent, or for
creating disadvantage for the entity or organization that the
respondent belongs to) or a report based on an identical or a similar
content (ex: any report with an identical or similar factual
background claimed in the previous report, or any report on the
investigation regarding the previous report) shall not be made.
23.2.1.3 All officers and employees who are involved with the
process of handling reports, from the receipt of a report to the

concerned whistleblowing.
23.2.2.4 Also, a case brought to the University's attention by means
other than a report, such as by a consultation without a clear
indication or a willingness of making a report, or by media coverage
or findings from external agency such as the Board of Audit, or by an
indication of suspected specified research misconduct made by the
scientific community such as an academic society or by information
of suspected specified research misconduct posted on a website, may
also be handled by the same procedures that handle cases initiated
by a report.
23.2.3 Retaliation Complaint
23.2.3.1 Any whistleblower who experiences retaliatory action for
making a good faith report of potential or suspected misconduct, or
who has been the subject of direct or indirect use or attempted use
of official authority or official influence for the purpose of interfering
with his or her right to make a Protected Disclosure, may file a
Retaliation Complaint to the Chief Operating Officer (hereinafter
referred to as "COO").
23.2.3.2 The Whistleblower Protection Policy shall apply to any
retaliation complaint filed by whistleblowers, attempted
whistleblowers or employees or members who have refused to obey
an Illegal Order.

23.4.1.1.1 Whistleblowers may report suspected misconduct to
the listed contact points by email, in writing, or by phone. It is
recommended to use the Whistleblower Report] as much as
possible in order to promptly implement the investigation.
23.4.1.1.2 As a basic rule, a report shall be made by identifying
the name of the whistleblower, and only a report that describes
details of the case, such as who has committed the suspected
misconduct, what kind of misconduct is committed, and a
rational ground, will be officially received.
23.4.1.1.3 Notwithstanding 23.4.1.1.2, whistleblowers may
report suspected misconduct anonymously by email, in writing
or by phone through the University's Misconduct Report Hotline
above. The hotline is taken care of by an external entity in order
to maintain confidentiality. The University will handle any
anonymous report received by the Hotline in accordance with
the equivalent procedures for reports made by identified
whistleblowers, taking account of the contents of the case.

6
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

Affairs.
23.4.1.1.5 When the contact point finds that the University is
not an entity to conduct investigation of the reported case, it will
forward the report to an entity that is the investigatory
organization. The University will handle any report of suspected
misconduct being forwarded from another entity deeming that
the report has been made to the University. Also, in the case of
the University finds that there is another entity that is in charge
of the investigation besides the University, it notifies said
another entity of the report.
23.4.1.1.6 When a contact point has received a report and the
fact as to whether or not it has officially received the report
cannot be known by the whistleblower, it notifies the
whistleblower that it has officially received the report (excluding
anonymous reports; however, if the whistleblower is identified
before issuance of an investigation report, the whistleblower is
treated as an identified whistleblower; the same applies
hereinafter).
23.4.1.1.7 When a consultation contains such a description
that misconduct is about to occur or a person is asked to commit
misconduct, the contact point notifies the COO, the Dean of
Research or the Dean of Faculty Affairs.
23.4.1.2 When an illegal activity violating the Act on the Protection
of Personal Information Held by Incorporated Administrative
Agencies, Etc. has taken place or is about to take place, a report may

Investigation will not be conducted. In this case, the Dean of
Faculty Affairs shall archive reference materials used in the
Preliminary Investigation, and, upon request by the relevant
Funding Agency, the Cabinet Office, the relevant ministries and
agencies or the whistleblower, disclose these archived references.
23.4.4.1.6 A report of a Preliminary Investigation and relevant
documents will be archived for 7 years at the University.
23.4.4.2 Substantial Investigation
23.4.4.2.1 Notifying and Reporting
i)
A Substantial Investigation is carried out by the Committee
to Promote the Responsible Conduct of Research (hereinafter,
“CPR”). The Dean of Faculty Affairs chairs the CPR, and
convenes meetings on a case bases selecting persons whom the
Dean of Faculty Affairs considers necessary from the people
listed below. Internal Faculty members and external members
are selected by the Dean of Faculty Affairs based on the research

Investigation will be carried out and ask them to cooperate with
16
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

the investigation. When the respondent belongs to an entity
other than the University, the notice will also be given to said
entity. The chairperson will, when it has established the CPR,
provide the whistleblower and the respondent with a list of
committee members identifying their organizations. In response
thereto the whistleblower and the respondent may file an
opposition within 7 days after he/she received said notification.
In the case where an opposition is filed, the chairperson will
review the contents of the opposition, and if the chairperson
finds the opposition is reasonable, it will replace the committee
member(s) objected in the opposition and notify the
complainant and the respondent of the replacement. In carrying
out the investigation of the alleged case, a special care shall be
used so that, unless the whistleblower agrees to the contrary, the
whistleblower cannot be identified by the respondent or a person
other than the persons working in the investigation.
ii)
The Dean of Faculty Affairs notifies the President/CEO,
the Board of Governors, Auditors, the Funding Agency, the
Cabinet Office and the relevant ministries and agencies that it
will carry out a Substantial Investigation.
iii) A Substantial Investigation shall be commenced no later
than 30 days after the decision to conduct the Substantial
Investigation.
23.4.4.2.2 Investigation Method and Delegated Power
i)
The Substantial Investigation will be carried out by
scrutinizing various reference materials such as manuscripts,
experimental or observational notebooks and raw data relating
to the research activities in question, conducting interviews with
relevant personnel, requesting reproduction of the same
experiments. In doing so, the respondent shall be given an
opportunity for explanation.
ii)
For investigating the possibility that the alleged Specified
Research Misconduct took place, when the CPR requests the
respondent to prove reproducibility by conducting the same
experiment or when the respondent voluntarily requests to do
such experiment and the CPR finds it necessary, the
reproduction of the same experiment will be carried out within
the extent that the CPR finds it reasonably necessary taking
account of a necessary period and opportunity (including
17
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

equipment, costs, and other relevant matters). In doing so,
guidance and supervision provided by the CPR will be followed.
iii) With respect to the Substantial Investigation, the CPR may
request other entities to conduct a necessary investigation.
iv) With respect to the preceding three paragraphs, the CPR
has the power to require concerned persons to submit reference
materials, appear in hearings and conduct reproduction of the
same experiment, and require the University to pay costs
reasonably necessary for the procedures. Also, concerned
persons including the whistleblower and the respondent shall
cooperate with the investigation carried out by the CPR based on
said delegated power in good faith.
23.4.4.2.3 Research Activities Subject to Investigation
In addition to the research activities in question, other research
activities which involve the respondent and are relevant to the
investigation may be subject to investigation at the discretion of
the CPR.
23.4.4.2.4 Measures for Preserving Evidence
In order to carry out a Substantial Investigation, the CPR will
take measures for preserving reference materials which may be
used as evidence for the research activities in question. In this
case, if the research activities in question took place at a venue
controlled by an entity other than the University, the CPR will
request the entity to take measures for preserving reference
materials which may be used as evidence for the research
activities in question. The respondent's research activities will
not be restricted to the extent that does not negatively affect
these measures.
23.4.4.2.5 Mid-term Investigation Report
If the Funding Agency, the Cabinet Office or the relevant
ministries and agencies which has distributed or took measures
for the budget of the research activities in question requests, the
President/CEO will submit a mid-term investigation report to
the Funding Agency, the Cabinet Office or the relevant ministries
and agencies even before the completion of the investigation,
and it will be reported to Auditors.
23.4.4.2.6 Protection of Research
Information Subject to Investigation

or

Technical

18
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

In carrying out investigation, a special care shall be used so that
research or technical information subject to investigation such
as data and manuscripts before publication will not be disclosed
beyond the extent that is just necessary for carrying out the
investigation. In a case where there are more than one
respondents, if it has been found that they were not collectively
involved in the alleged misconduct, investigation reports may be
prepared individually for these respondents, for the sake of
maintaining confidentiality.
23.4.4.3 Determination
23.4.4.3.1 Determination
i)
The CPR will complete documentation of the results of the
investigation within 150 days from the commencement of the
Substantial Investigation and make a determination as to
whether or not Specified Research Misconduct took place.
ii)
If it is determined that Specified Research Misconduct
took place, the CPR will further determine the details thereof,
including name of persons involved in the Specified Research
Misconduct, the degree of involvement of each person, and the
roles of authors of the manuscripts relating to the research
activities being determined as Specified Research Misconduct in
said manuscripts or in said research activities.
iii) When it is determined that Specified Research Misconduct
did not take place, if it has been found that the reporting was bad
faith, the CPR will make the determination of bad faith reporting
at the same time. In doing so, the whistleblower shall be given
an opportunity for explanation.
iv) Upon completion of the determinations according to the
preceding three paragraphs, the CPR will immediately report the
determinations to the President/CEO.
23.4.4.3.2 Accountability for Reporting of Specified
Research Misconduct
In the investigation carried out by the CPR, when the respondent
intends to remove the suspicions over the research activities in
question, the respondent shall explain, under his/her own
responsibility, that the research activities have been carried out
in accordance with scientifically appropriate methods and
procedures, and the papers have been written based thereon
19
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

using appropriate expressions, presenting scientific evidence
that supports his/her explanation.
23.4.4.3.3 Determination Whether or Not Specified
Research Misconduct Took Place
i)
The CPR takes into account the explanation given by the
respondent under the preceding paragraph and makes
comprehensive evaluation of all evidence obtained by the
investigation including physical or scientific evidence,
testimonies and self-admission of the respondent, to determine
whether or not Specified Research Misconduct took place.
Credibility of evidence is determined by the evaluation of the
CPR, but, to determine factual basis of the misconduct and
intentionality, it is important to take account of various aspects
such as the organizational mechanisms applied to the research
of the respondent and how the data were checked in the
mechanisms. In addition, determination that Specified Research
Misconduct took place cannot be made if the respondent's selfadmission is the only evidence supporting the determination.
ii)
In the case where evidence supporting the Specified
Research Misconduct is submitted, when a suspicion that the
Specified Research Misconduct took place cannot be reversed by
the respondent's explanation and other evidence, the
determination that Specified Research Misconduct took place
will be made. Also, the same applies to the case where the
respondent is unable to present sufficient evidence that reverses
the suspicion that Specified Research Misconduct took place due
to lack of basic elements which normally exist in research
activities, such as lack of raw data, experimental or observational
notebooks, experimental materials or reagents. However, this
does not apply to the case where it is found that there is a
justifiable reason for that, such as when the respondent had used
a good manager's care and the inability of presenting sufficient
evidence based on the basic elements was due to a cause beyond
control of the respondent (such as loss by disaster). Also, the
same applies to the case where lack of raw data, experimental or
observational notebooks, experimental materials or reagents,
etc. is because of expiry of the reasonable period for storage
specified by OIST Guidelines on Research Data and Laboratory
Notebooks [link: TBP] or the research institution that the
respondent belonged to when he/she was carrying out the
alleged research activities.
20
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

iii) Specific standard of proof regarding the preceding two
paragraphs and basic elements which should normally exist in
research activities as mentioned in the preceding paragraph are
determined by the CPR taking account of the characteristics of
the relevant research field.
iv) A report of a Substantial Investigation and relevant
documents will be archived for 7 years at the University.
23.4.4.3.4 Notifying and Reporting of Results of
Investigation
i)
The President/CEO will promptly notify the whistleblower
and the respondent (including those who are other than the
respondent and determined to be involved in the Specified
Research Misconduct; the same applies hereinafter) of the
results of the investigation (including the determination; the
same applies hereinafter). When the respondent belongs to an
entity other than the University, said entity will also be notified
of said results of the investigation.
ii)
In addition to the preceding paragraph, the President/CEO
will report said results of the investigation to the Board of
Governors, Auditors, the Funding Agency, the Cabinet Office
and the relevant ministries and agencies.
iii) When the reporting by the whistleblower was determined
to be bad faith, the President/CEO will also notify the entity that
the complainant belongs to.
23.4.4.3.5 Appeal
i)
The respondent of the reporting being determined as the
Specified Research Misconduct may file an appeal to the within
14 days from the date of notification of the results of the
investigation. However, once an appeal is filed, another appeal
based on the same reason cannot be filed even before the expiry
of said period.
ii)
The whistleblower (including those who have been
determined as making a bad faith reporting in the appeal
proceedings initiated by the respondent; the provision of
“23.4.4.3.3 Determination Whether or Not Specified Research
Misconduct Took Place” above will apply mutatis mutandis to
the determination in this case) whose reporting has been
21
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

determined to be bad faith may file an appeal, by applying
mutatis mutandis the preceding paragraph.
iii) Review in the appeal proceedings will be handled by the
CPR. In doing so, if claims of the appeal may require a new
determination based on expert knowledge, the President/CEO
will replace or add committee members or delegate the review to
another body in place of the CPR. However, this does not apply
to the case where the President/CEO finds there is no reasonable
ground for requiring a change of the members of the CPR with
respect to said appeal proceedings.
iv) With respect to the appeal proceedings initiated by the
respondent in the case being determined that Specified Research
Misconduct took place, the CPR (including those in place of the
CPR according to (iii) above; the same applies hereinafter in
“23.4.4.3.5 Appeal”) will promptly determine whether or not it
will carry out re-investigation of the case, taking account of the
claims and the ground of appeal and other relevant matters. If it
determines that the appeal should be dismissed without the need
of carrying out re-investigation of said case, it will promptly
report the President/CEO thereof, and the President/CEO will
notify the respondent of said determination. In this case, if the
CPR finds that the primary purpose of said appeal is to delay the
conclusion of said case or to postpone the measures to be taken
relating to a possible determination, the President/CEO may
decide not to receive a further appeal. When a determination to
carry out re-investigation has been made regarding the appeal of
(i) above, the CPR will request the respondent to cooperate with
the re-investigation for prompt resolution of the case, such as
submission of reference materials that can be sufficient evidence
to overturn the conclusion of the earlier investigation. If the
respondent is not cooperative, the CPR may decide to terminate
the review without conducting re-investigation. In that case, the
President/CEO will immediately be reported of the decision, and
the President/CEO will notify the respondent of said decision.
v)
When the President/CEO has received an appeal from the
respondent regarding the determination that Specified Research
Misconduct took place, it will notify the whistleblower thereof.
In addition, the President /CEO will report the relevant Funding
Agency, the Cabinet Office, the relevant ministries and agencies
thereof and Auditors. The same applies to the case where it has
decided to dismiss the appeal or to carry out re-investigation.
22
ch23_misconduct-and-whistleblower-protection_en_20181120_cl

vi) When the CPR has started re-investigation, it will decide,
within a period of 50 days, whether or not it will overturn the
conclusion of the earlier investigation, and immediately report
the President/CEO of the decision, and then, the President/CEO
will notify the decision to the respondent, the entity that the
respondent belongs to and the whistleblower. In addition, the
President/CEO will report the same to the relevant Funding
Agency, the Cabinet Office, the relevant ministries and agencies
and Auditors.
vii) Upon receipt of an appeal from the whistleblower of the
reporting being determined to be bad faith as provided in (ii)
above, the President/CEO will notify the entity that the
whistleblower belongs to and the respondent thereof. In
addition, the University will report the same to the relevant
Funding Agency, the Cabinet Office, the relevant ministries and
agencies and Auditors.
viii) With respect to the appeal according to (ii) above, the CPR
will carry out re-investigation within 30 days, and will
immediately report the President/CEO of the results thereof.
The University will notify the results of the review to the
whistleblower, the entity that the whistleblower belongs to and
the respondent. In addition, the University will report the same
to the relevant Funding Agency, the Cabinet Office, the relevant
ministries and agencies and Auditors.
23.4.4.3.6 Public Announcement of The Results of
Investigation
i)
When it has been determined that Specified Research
Misconduct took place, the President/CEO promptly makes
public the results of the investigation including the category of
Specified Research Misconduct, researcher(s), expenses and
subject of research project, and specific description of the
Specified Research Misconduct and other required information.

determined that the reporting was bad faith, the results of the
investigation will be made public.
iii) When information of an investigated case has been
divulged and become known to a person other than those in
charge of the case, the President/CEO may officially explain the
investigated case even if the investigation is ongoing, provided
that the whistleblower and the respondent give consent to do so.
However, if the divulgence of information is due to a cause
attributable to the whistleblower or the respondent, consent of
the person is not necessary.
23.4.4.3.7 Measures
for
Whistleblowers
and
Respondents
i)
When it has been determined that Specified Research
Misconduct took place, the President/CEO will take appropriate

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules and Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 24. Childcare Services
24.1 Policy
The OIST Graduate University (hereinafter “the University”) recognizes the
critical needs of the university staff, students, and visitors with children for
international and high-quality pre-school and after-school/holiday education
services. To meet such needs is one of the basic functions which the University
must fulfill to attract and retain the best talent, enhance the wellbeing of the
University community and thereby achieve the missions of the University.
The University provides the pre-school and after-school/holiday programs
designed to meet such needs as much as possible by establishing and
operating the OIST Child Development Center (CDC). The services are
provided at dedicated, safe facilities on campus. While the CDC is established
as a part of the University, it has a semi-autonomous decision-making body,
the CDC Governing Board, with representation from the relevant
administrative divisions of the University, the CDC management and the OIST
Child Care Association [link: ]. Please refer to the Bylaws (terms of reference)
of the Governing Board [link: ] for its responsibilities and membership. The
CDC Governing Board reports to the University President who reports to the
Board of Governors of the OIST School.

Policies, Rules & Procedures

Chapter 25. Housing
25.1

Policy

25.1.1
The University undertakes to provide housing on campus for
approximately half of its academic population. The objective is to provide
housing for all incoming students during their first year at the University,
and for most incoming researchers and faculty, to ease their transition to
life in Okinawa and at the University. The expectation is that some faculty
and researchers will choose instead to live off campus. After the first year,
students can choose to remain on campus or move off campus. When no
appropriate on campus housing is available for an employee, and if the
CEO/President identifies the employee as one who should reside
adjacently to the campus to accomplish her/his duty, the University may
rent off campus housing for the employee, which is designated in advance
by the University. This policy enables the University to provide sufficient
housing and related facilities for incoming members of the academic
population, while still providing business opportunities for Okinawa
developers, landlords and real estate companies to benefit from the
presence of the University and its researchers in Okinawa.
25.1.2
Campus housing is made up of a mix of apartments and houses
intended to cater to a range of academic residents, from single students
sharing an apartment, to researchers and faculty members who have
partners and children living with them.
25.1.3
Housing and related welfare facilities are designed to make life
comfortable for residents from a wide range of nationalities, backgrounds
and age-groups. The buildings are designed to suit the climate and
environment of the campus, within the limits of the budget available for
their development.
25.1.4
All academic members of the OIST population are eligible to apply
for residence in on-campus housing. Executives [link: 30.2.2.1.1] are also
1
ch25_Faculty-Staff-and-Student-Housing_20150601_ja_cl

eligible to live on campus, but administrative staff are offered on-campus
housing only by exception.
25.1.5
Housing is provided on a subsidized basis. In principle, residents
are responsible for 20% of the rent amount of their housing, with the
balance provided by OIST, subject to established limits.
25.1.6
Residents are responsible for all utility costs incurred in their
apartments or houses.
25.2

General considerations

Partnership with Okinawa Scientists Village Co., Ltd (the Developer).

specification agreed between the two parties. Upon completion of the
buildings, ownership has been transferred to OIST, and OIST has entered
into a Master Lease with the Developer to operate and maintain the
housing on behalf of the university for a period of 30 years. In principle,
the Developer’s sole source of income is the rental fees derived from the
use of the housing by members of the university. To ensure the commercial
viability of the project for the Developer, OIST has given an undertaking to
maintain an agreed level of occupancy in the housing.
25.2.2
Notwithstanding the above (25.2.1), certain costs for long-term
renovation of the housing are to be borne by OIST, in accordance with
provisions set out in the Project Contract between OIST and the Developer.
25.2.3
In principle, housing is provided on an unfurnished basis.
However, OIST has furnished a number of apartments and houses for use
by incoming students, researchers and faculty without their own furniture.
A separate monthly charge is made by the university to residents in
furnished housing to recover the replacement cost of the items installed.
25.2.4
A limited number of furnished houses and apartments are held by
the university for short-term use by visiting faculty and researchers.
Eligibility and conditions are set out in 21.3.1.2. [link: 21.5.4].

Chapter 27: Budget planning, execution and monitoring
27.1 Policy
The University’s budget planning process aims at allocating its resources and at
maximizing their utilization to achieve the University’s strategic mission.
The goal of the budget execution monitoring is to provide accurate information to
managers responsible for the use of the University’s funds and to assist them in the
exercise of their responsibility.
These two functions, planning and monitoring, also provide the President and the
Board of Governors (BOG) and the Board of Councilors (BOC) with an analytical tool
enabling them to oversee the financial operations, status, and health of the
University.
The University has a responsibility to submit an annual budget plan to the BOG each
year.
This policy outlines the University’s annual budget process and describes the budget
components and other related procedures integral to the process.
This policy applies to all University administrative divisions, research units and
affiliated programs in their preparation and management of operating and capital
budgets.
27.2 General Considerations
The budget breakdown structure is designed to reflect as much as possible the
University organizational and management structure, allowing for a clear
identification of responsibilities and accountabilities.
The exercise of budgetary responsibilities requires easy access to accurate and timely
information on budget execution status. The University implements an ERP system
that enables such access. Budget Supervisors and Budget Holders must be familiar
with this system before accepting budgetary responsibility.
The President undertakes budget allocation upon delegation from the BOG, which
has the ultimate authority and responsibility for the management and operation of
the Corporation, through the Vice President for Financial Management, under the
supervision of COO. The Vice President for Financial Management sub-delegates his
Page 1 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

responsibility for budget planning and execution to the Vice President or equivalent
(see 2.4.5 [link: 2.4.5]) accountable for budget execution.
Budget revisions and reallocations are possible after the initial budget allocation.
Income and Expenditure Budget consists the budget of the University. The budget of
the University consolidates all University sources of funding, and all its operation
expenses and capital expenditures, including building and facilities.
27.3 Rules
27.3.1 Budget term
The budget term of the University is April 1st to March 31st.
27.3.2 Budgetary Breakdown Structure, Budgetary Units and budget
authority
The budget of the University is compiled, executed and monitored according to
a hierarchical structure, the Budgetary Breakdown Structure that reflects the
University organization to the largest possible extent (fig. 1).

Budget Supervisors (Vice President and equivalent) must distribute the budget

Regardless of the above, for external funding, such as Kakenhi and Funded
Research, a grantee or a principal investigator of the contract becomes the
Budget Holder.
In the event that a Budget Supervisor is unable to act or a position becomes
vacant, the COO shall appoint a proxy to whom budgetary authority is formally
delegated until the position has been filled.
27.3.3 Budget Breakdown Units
Budget Breakdown units are the lowest budgetary breakdown of the University
for budget allocation and reporting. Budget Supervisors are responsible for
defining the Budget Breakdown Units structure and denomination under the
Section level of the organization.
Budget Breakdown Units have two functions: a) to provide a level of precision
in the budget planning and budget execution that allows accurate monitoring
and informed decisions and b) to facilitate adjustment of budget structure in
Page 4 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

case of organizational changes by allowing redistribution of coherent Budget
Breakdown Units that preserve tracking continuity and possibility of year to
year comparison despite changes of perimeters.
27.3.3.1 Budget Breakdown Units attached to Sources of funding
The funding of the University comes from various sources with specific
requirements and restrictions on how these funds may be used and
reported. In order to facilitate recording and reporting of these funds
utilization, it is necessary to create separate Budget Breakdown Units
for each funding source. It is the responsibility of each Budget
Supervisor and of the relevant sections leaders under his/her
supervision1 to inform the Budget Section when they receive external
funding and to communicate corresponding recording and reporting
requirements.
27.3.3.2 Combining different source of funding
Combining different source of funding is allowed unless it is prohibited
by laws and/or the rules of particular subsidies, and other source of
funding.
Budget Supervisors are responsible for confirming those constraints
and informing the Budget Section.
27.3.3.3 Budget Breakdown Units attached to deposit in favor of
Researchers, Students
Many subsidies, grants, scholarship etc. are granted to individual
researchers but may be under the custody of their host institution
which is required to manage the funds on their behalf. In such cases,
funds are treated as deposits and their use is reported on behalf of the
recipient. The Budget Supervisor of these external funding treated as
deposits is responsible for informing the Budget Section of specific
constraints before funds consumption actually occurs. Specific Budget
Breakdown Units are created to enable the monitoring of these
individual funds.
27.3.3.4 Budget Breakdown Units and coordinated projects
Specific activities or projects are carried out under the responsibility of
a project manager/Budget Holder but require coordinated actions and
spending from different part of the organization. In such case a specific
Budget Breakdown Unit is created within the section of the Budget
Holder of the project, with a budget to which other sections involved in
the project may access. This allows the project manager to monitor the
project budget execution despite the diversity of spending sections.
1

The Sponsored Research Section works particularly closely with the Budget Section to ensure timely
and accurate reporting to funding agencies.

Page 5 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

The Budget Supervisor of the section holding “project Budget
Breakdown Units” is responsible for communicating its specific
requirements, use restrictions or other information to the “Budget
Section”.
27.3.4 Main Budget categories for expenditure
27.3.4.1 Budget categories for subsidies for operation and subsidies for
construction
The University uses several main budget categories for compilation and
monitoring of its budget allocation and execution. These categories
may vary with different sources of funding (see 27.3.4.2 [link:
27.3.4.2]).
Categories “by default” for subsidies for operation and all other
unrestricted sources of funding are:
1
Personnel expenses (PEREX)
2
Operational expenses, non personnel (OPEX)
3
Capital expenditure (CAPEX)
Categories “by default” for subsidies for construction are:
1
Construction work
2
Ancillary cost
These main categories are broken down in more detailed subcategories.
The University budgetary system used by all Budget Supervisors and
Budget Holders is based upon this allocation structure.
27.3.4.2 Specific budget categories for different sources of funding
Funding agencies, Foundations, research sponsors have often specific
requirements for reporting the use of their funds. The Budget
Supervisor of the receiving Division is responsible for communicating
these specific requirements, any use restrictions or other information
on use of funds to the “Budget Section”.
Budgeting the use of common and shared facilities and
equipment
The University encourages sharing of its resources such as facilities and
equipment. These common resources are under the responsibility of specific
sections which must also budget for their acquisition, maintenance and
operation.
Users of these common and shared facilities and equipment must budget only
for the direct costs associated with their specific utilization (mostly
27.3.5

Page 6 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

consumable). It is not necessary to budget for the fraction of the total
operating cost corresponding to their use time.
However, the University will implement, in some situation, a cost monitoring
of these common and shared facilities and equipment and report this cost to
the users, for information and benchmarking.
27.4 Authorities & Responsibilities
27.4.1 Board of Governors (BOG)
The BOG makes decisions on the budget and financial plans and oversees the
budget execution of the Corporation. (Article 3, Paragraph 1, item 10 of the
Rules for the operation of the BOG [link: http://iwww.oist.jp/document/prpaux/99_BOGRule.pdf])
27.4.2 Board of Councilors (BOC)
The President must hear the opinions of the BOC beforehand regarding the
following items.
(1) Handling of budgets
(2) Acceptance of new obligations or release of rights outside the budget
(Article 21 of the Bylaws [link:
https://groups.oist.jp/sites/default/files/imce/u113/oistsc_bylaws.pdf])
27.4.3 President
The President receives delegation from the BOG for the management of the
University and is responsible and accountable for the execution of the annual
plan and corresponding budget. The President reviews and is accountable for
the budget plans submitted by the Budget Supervisors of each Division. The
President may delegate some of his/her duties necessary for such purpose to
the Vice President for Financial Management, under the supervision of the
COO.
The University budget plans shall be compiled by the President before the
beginning of each fiscal year, and must be approved at a BOG meeting. This
shall also apply when any major changes are instituted to budgets plans.
After approval of the business and budget plans by the BOG, the COO informs
the University staff in order to enhance transparency and accountability
regarding the next year’s business plan specifying budget priorities and
implementation.
27.4.4 Budget Supervisors
Budget Supervisors are responsible for the timely and reliable planning and
careful implementation within the limitation of the budget approved of their
Division’s budget through efficient operation and strict monitoring.
Page 7 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

27.4.5 Vice President for Financial Management
The Vice President for Financial Management shall be responsible for all
aspects of the budget and have the responsibility, as the head of the Financial
Management Division, to proceed with budget planning and compilation for
the entire University, communication and negotiation with the Cabinet Office
in the course of making budget requests to the Government, formulation of
plans for budget allocation within the University, execution and execution
monitoring of the determined budget plans, and other tasks, under the
supervision of the President and the COO.
With respect to the monitoring of budget execution, the Vice President for
Financial Management shall confirm the budget execution results of each
Budgetary Unit for the month and submit the Budget execution status report
to the Budget Supervisors, the COO and the President every month.
In addition, the Vice President for Financial Management shall review the
budget execution results of each Division after the closing of each fiscal year
and submit an annual report to the President and to the BOG.
27.4.6 Budget Section
The Budget Section shall perform operations necessary for budget planning
and compilation for the entire University, communication and negotiation
with the Cabinet Office in the course of making budget requests to the
Government, formulation of plans for budget allocation within the University,
execution and execution monitoring of the determined budget plans, and
other tasks, under the supervision of the Vice President for Financial
Management.
In addition, the Budget Section is responsible for monitoring all budgeted
funds appropriated by the University as approved by the BOG, and subject to
mandates, regulations and procedures established by the University or by the
institutions providing the funds.
27.4.7 University personnel
27.4.7.1 Appropriate use of the University budget
All University personnel are responsible for timely and reliable
execution of their task within the limit of the budget allocated to their
Budgetary Units, in accordance with the regulations of the University.
27.4.7.2 Familiarity with, and use of supporting IT infrastructure
The University uses the ERP system to compile, execute and manage its
budget. This system supports most financial transactions of the
University and is the basis for budget execution monitoring. All
University personnel having disbursement or budgetary responsibility

Page 8 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

are expected to be trained and familiar with the functions necessary to
the effective fulfillment of their tasks.
27.4.7.3 Budget Analysts
The Budget Analysts at their respective Divisions shall offer practical
support for the Budget Supervisors with regard to budget planning and
compilation, preparation of budget request materials, budget execution
and execution management, for which the Budget Supervisors are
responsible.
27.5 Procedures
27.5.1 Budget planning and compilation
Budget planning shall be performed by the respective Budget
Supervisors in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 27.5.
Budget compilation at the University level shall be performed by the
Vice President for Financial Management under the supervision of the
COO and determined by the President.
Budget Supervisors must submit budget plans with sufficient details.
Operation expenses and capital expenditures must be itemized to be
able to justify their budget request.
The budgeting of personnel salaries is complex because it includes
indirect costs related to taxes and benefits. For that reason, even if
personnel salaries are charged to their Budgetary Units, they are not
directly managed by the Budget Supervisors at the time of the budget
allocation. However, the Budget Supervisors are responsible for the
management of the personnel whom they supervise and must plan for
headcount and qualifications at section levels and for minimizing the
amount of overtime, which is not budgeted.
27.5.2 Multi-annual planning
The University plans its budget and monitors its execution on an annual
basis. Accounting rules applying to the main source of the University
funding, subsidies for Operation from the Japanese Government
(Hojokin) do not allow for multiannual budgeting, in principle.
When other sources of funding allow the University to make a multiannual plan or when a project requires multi-annual budget planning,
the Budget Supervisors and the Budget Section shall consider how to
include such needs in the planning process. The Budget Supervisor
requiring multi-annual budget planning is responsible for
communicating its specific requirements to the Budget Section.
Please see the guidelines of multi-year contract and contract crossing
the fiscal year end [link: ].
Page 9 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

27.5.3 Annual Budget Cycle for Government subsidies
Each Budget Supervisor shall draft his or her Division’s budget request
for the coming fiscal year and necessary materials in accordance with
the budget request schedule presented by the Vice President for
Financial Management. This draft is structured according to Budgetary
Units and Budget categories confirmed by the Budget Section.
After consolidation, the Vice President for Financial Management shall
inform the Cabinet Office of the amount requested for Subsidies for
Operations and Subsidies for Construction, under the supervision of the
COO. There are several iterations between the University and Cabinet
Office before the budget request is finalized. During such process, the
Cabinet Office might request us to provide additional explanatory
materials that are necessary for the budget request, in which case the
Budget Supervisor for the relevant budget item shall be responsible for
preparing the appropriate materials within the deadline.
Advance notification on the Subsidies for Operation and for
Construction for the coming fiscal year set forth in the government
budget draft is usually given by the Cabinet Office at the end of
December. However, the government budget draft is officially be
approved by the Diet. Said approval is generally be granted at the end of
March; however, it is subject to change to some extent.
27.5.4 Initial budget request by Budget Supervisors (PEREX, OPEX
AND CAPEX)
27.5.4.1 Personnel plan and salaries budgeting
Budget Supervisors must submit their personnel plan for the coming
year at the time of the first budget compilation, after careful review of
current internal situation and staff availability and expected workload
for next fiscal year.
The estimate of corresponding salaries shall be made by the Gender
Equality and Human Resource Development Division on the basis of
this information.
After consolidation, in accordance with the same procedure applicable
to the University budget in general, the Vice President for Gender
Equality and Human Resource Development shall conduct compilation
and consult with the Vice President for Financial Management
concerning the PEREX budget under the supervision of the COO, with
necessary adjustment being reviewed by the COO and the Executives
and with the final decision being made by the President.
27.5.4.2 Capital expenditure (CAPEX) plan – Research equipment and
software
The Dean of Research shall collect and compile opinions of faculty
Page 10 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

members and other persons concerned on the CAPEX plan for research
equipment while the Vice President for Information Technology shall
collect and compile opinions of faculty members and other persons
concerned on the CAPEX plan for IT and software.
In order to avoid unnecessary duplication of research
equipment/software and to maximize sharing, research
equipment/software purchases and renewal plans shall be reviewed for
equipment with purchasing costs of JPY 3M or more.
Equipment purchase requests must include the direct cost and other
ancillary costs such as laboratory fitting cost, maintenance cost,
additional personnel cost etc.
The CAPEX for those other than research equipment, IT and software
shall be compiled by the Financial Management Division and
incorporated into the budget compilation together with the CAPEX for
research equipment, IT and software and adjusted by the Vice
President for Financial Management under the supervision of the COO
and determined by the President.
27.5.5 Annual budget allocation of subsidies for operation (OPEX
and CAPEX)
27.5.5.1 Annual budget allocation of subsidies for operation
At the beginning of the budget compilation process, the President shall,
based on advice from the Vice President for Financial Management,
make a first allocation of subsidies for operations (OPEX and CAPEX)
and headcounts to each Budget Supervisor on the basis of preliminary
assumptions (“top down allocation”).
The Resource Allocation Committee (RAC) is responsible for advising
the President through the Executive Committee on the budget
allocations. The Terms of Reference and the membership of the RAC
shall be stipulated separately by the COO.
The Budget Supervisors are responsible for allocation of subsidies for
operation between OPEX and CAPEX within their Divisions down to
the Budget Breakdown Unit level. They are also required to confirm
their personnel plan (headcounts and qualifications). After
consolidation, necessary adjustment shall be reviewed and subjected to
approval by the COO.
27.5.5.2 Budget pre-allocation
For activities starting at the beginning of the new Fiscal Year such as
annual contracts which must be tendered several weeks before actual
start, events with fixed dates etc. it may be necessary to allocate a
Page 11 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

budget even before the start of the fiscal year (budget pre-allocation).
Such pre-allocations are exceptional and must be requested to the Vice
President for Financial Management.
It must be noted that the pre-allocation is for budget management
convenience but is not a firm allocation. It cannot be contracted or
encumbered before the actual budget has been confirmed on April 1st of
the new fiscal year. It is the Budget Supervisor’s responsibility to not
encumber the amount pre-allocated before it is legally permitted.
27.5.5.3 Contingency budget
The President may request the Vice President for Financial
Management to set aside contingency funds in order to respond in a
timely manner to unexpected events, including emergency actions for
natural disasters. Contingency budgets cannot be set aside by the
Budget Supervisors, but they may request that the Vice President for
Financial Management set aside a specific contingency budget only if
an appropriate justification exists.
27.5.5.4 Unallocated Budget
The Vice President for Financial Management may, upon consultation
with the President and the COO, decide to not allocate a fraction of
funds available at the time of the annual budget allocation when further
studies are required before these funds can be budgeted with sufficient
accuracy and reliability.
27.5.6 Allocation of overheads from external funding sources
Overheads from external funding received by the University are consolidated
in the budget of the President Office, regardless of the primary beneficiary of
this external funding. The Vice President for Financial Management shall
prepare a draft of allocation of these overhead costs in accordance with the
needs of the University and the expenditure rules of the relevant funding
organization before the COO makes a decision on the allocation.
Unless separately provided for by the relevant funding organization, the
amount the University request for overheads shall be 30% of the total amount
received.
The allocation of Indirect Cost of Competitive Grants shall be determined by
the COO in accordance with the University’s Guidelines for Indirect Cost of
Competitive Grants [link:]
27.5.7 Construction plan
The Vice President for Building and Facilities Management is primarily
responsible for the allocation of funds available for construction, in
accordance with the categories of subsidies received (subsidies for operation
and subsidies for construction), and he or she shall periodically consult with
Page 12 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

the COO, the Vice President for Financial Management and the Associate Vice
President for Administrative Compliance regarding appropriate budgetary
execution.
This allocation is consolidated into the general budget of the University by the
Budget Section.
27.5.8 Budget allocation in ERP system and ERP-HR
The President shall allocate budgets to be supervised by each Budget
Supervisor. The actual allocated amounts can be confirmed in the ERP
system.
27.5.9 Budget execution in ERP system
All financial transactions have to be recorded in the ERP system.
27.5.9.1 “Before the fact” ERP system entry
Execution of budget always has to be recorded in the ERP system prior
to the actual action of execution such as initiating a tender with an
estimated price, signing a contract, making an order, arranging a
business trip, planning an event that requires a payment of
honorarium.
The University may not accept the delivery of goods, service and/nor be
able to reimburse the cost if transactions are not recorded “before the
fact.”
This is necessary to allow an up to date and reliable projection of the
University commitment towards its creditors.
27.5.10 Budget execution monitoring and adjustments
27.5.10.1
Monitoring of budget execution
The budget execution status of each Division is reviewed by the Vice
President for Financial Management with the Budget Supervisors.
Budget execution status reports are generated to serve as a reference.
The budget execution monitoring report is structured according to
Budgetary Unit levels.
27.5.10.2
Revision of Budget
The budget established at the beginning of the fiscal year serves as a
reference and cannot be modified. However, circumstances may
impose a revision of the budget projection during the fiscal year. The
Budget Section proceeds with an annual budget allocation re-estimate
when it is necessary.
Decisions on these additional budget revisions are made by the COO in
consultation with the Vice President for Financial Management when it
is apparent that one or more Divisions will overspend or underspend,
thus requiring a revision of budget allocation and arbitration.
Page 13 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

The revised budget and the redistributed budget (refer to Section
27.5.10.5) shall be registered in the ERP-Core system by the Budget
Section and become the new reference against which the budget
execution is monitored. The initial budget remains as a baseline
reference.
27.5.10.3
Over spending in a section within a Division
When over spending is anticipated in one Budgetary Unit, the Budget
Supervisor of the Division to which this Unit belongs should first
compensate this overspending with savings made in other sections
under his/her responsibility.
In case the source of funding allows multi annual budget management
the Budget Supervisor should take the necessary measures to correct
the overspending in one year from savings made in the subsequent
year(s).
27.5.10.4
Under spending
When a Budget Supervisor anticipates that his/her Division will not use
its entire budget, he/she should notify the Vice President for Financial
Management as soon as possible in order to enable a corporate-wide
budget redistribution aimed at efficient use of budgeted amounts. Once
this notification is accepted, the budget registered in the ERP system
will be revised accordingly as soon as possible by Budget Section.
27.5.10.5
Redistribution of budget amount within and across main
budget categories by Budget Supervisors
Budget redistribution within budget categories is possible as an
acceptable way of adjusting allocation of resources to the actual
environment and evolution of priorities.
The redistribution across budget categories cannot take place
indiscriminately because they create different liabilities and have
different impacts on the University’s long-term use of its resources.
Redistribution across categories shall be adjusted and determined by
the Vice President for Financial Management under the supervision of
the COO. For such purpose, the Budget Section must confirm that the
aforementioned redistribution is compatible with the restrictions
attached to sources of funding.
27.5.10.6
Use of contingency funds
In case of emergency or unforeseeable events, the President for
Financial Management may, upon the instruction of the President and
under the supervision of the COO, decide to use the contingency funds
Page 14 of 16
ch27_budget-planning-execution-and-monitoring_en_20180401_cl

under his/her custody, specifying the purpose thereof. The use of
contingency funds must comply, in principle, with the rules applying to
the source of funds from which they are allocated (e.g. subsidies from
operations). However, in case of extreme urgency, the COO may decide
to use these funds with the explicit approval of the Vice President for
Financial Management.
The COO may delegate the responsibility for using specified amounts of
the contingency funds to Budget Supervisors when it is necessary.
The contingency funds should not be held until the end of the fiscal
year and must be allocated gradually to normal operational usage as
the probability of their necessity decreases.
27.5.10.7
Budget carry-over
Carry-over of subsidy budgets to next fiscal year is allowed
exceptionally and only in cases the following criteria are met.
(1) Carry-over is allowed in the laws and rules of the source of funding
(2) Approval of carry-over by the government or funding agency is
obtained. (In case prior approval is required.)
A budget carry-over includes the expenditures and the resources
corresponding to the expenditures being carried-over. It therefore
neutral from a budget balance perspective.
27.5.10.8
Reporting to other funding organizations
Reporting to funding agencies is usually done according to specific rules
and forms. Budget Supervisors need to be aware that missing deadline
or improper documentation may result in penalty such as
disqualification for applying other funding or order to return the funds.

27.6 Prohibition of self-approval
Budget execution in cases in which the requester and the approver are the
same person is not allowed under any circumstances in OIST. (Prohibition of
self-approval)

Misconduct of this nature is subject to disciplinary action in

accordance with Chapter 23, Misconduct & Whistleblower Protection and
Chapter 38, Discipline.

ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

Caution: Personal gifts or gratuities from vendors must be
declined, and if received, returned to the vendors or suppliers.
This and other conflict of interest and commitment concerns are
addressed in detail in Chapter 22, Avoiding Conflicts of Interest
and Commitment.
28.2.2 Conflicts of Interest
The University expects its faculty and staff to avoid any real or potential
conflict of interest when procuring goods or services on its behalf. For
additional information, refer to our Code of Conduct and our Conflicts of
Interest & Commitment policy.
28.2.3 Unauthorized Purchases
Persons in charge of units or sections must not make unauthorized
purchases, that is, those that are not in compliance with any aspect of this
or other the University policy. Such purposes include improper bidding,
making commitments for payments without proper authorization, and
making false inspection records. Because unauthorized purchases
increase legal and financial risks for the University, persons in charge of
units and sections or their supervisors making such purchases may be
held personally liable and/or subject to disciplinary action.
28.2.4 Business Purpose
Persons in charge of units or sections and their supervisors must not
make purchases that are not for an approved business purpose (Examples
of items not for an approved business purpose: [link: ]) (See Appendix
28.A. Non exhaustive list of purchases approved for business purpose
[link: ].). Procurement of goods or services for personal use is strictly
prohibited, as is the use of University discounts or its tax-exempt status.
The point service, which accumulates points through purchase of
business purpose and enables to receive discount or item, is

2
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

recommended to use for the business purpose transactions in the next
time or after. Procurement for the purposes of resale must be made in
accordance with the requirements of this Chapter. See also Chapter 21,
Use of University Resources.
28.2.5 Disclosure of Contract Information
According to Stipulation on Contract Management, the University
discloses the following information regarding past and future
procurements on its website.


Negotiated contracts of more than 5 million JPY: the University
discloses the contracts and the reasons for selecting that contractor.



Construction contracts: the University discloses fiscal year
construction forecasts, bidding and contract execution processes,
and similar relevant information.

28.3 Rules
The University must comply with the laws and regulations of Japan governing its
operation. Additionally, persons in charge of units and sections and their
supervisors making purchases on behalf of the University must adhere to the
specific practices set out in this Chapter concerning soliciting, purchasing, and
paying for goods, services and construction with University funds.
28.3.1 Procurement Agents
Vendor selection and approval must be managed by an authorized agent
of the University. The University’s procurement agents must identify the
best, most qualified and/or suitable vendor to meet the needs of the
University, while complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
Only the Procurement and Supplies section and the facility related
sections may purchase goods, services and construction. However, in
situations where the amount of purchase is less than 0.5 million JPY per
order, persons in charge of

units or sections

other than the

3
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

Procurement and Supplies section and the sections under the supervision
of Vice President for Buildings & Facility Management (the facility
related sections) can purchase from vendors when they procure goods
and services. When units or sections procure goods, services and
construction, the prior subject to approval of Budget holder is necessary
regardless of the amount. For placing an order, only an official authorized
purchase order form by the University should be used.
28.3.1.1

Approval on budget holder’s behalf

When the amount of purchase is less than 0.5 million JPY, budget
holder may allow a certain individual to approve procurement of
goods and services on ERP system on his/her behalf. In this case, the
budget holder must specify the scope, reason, and time limit by
submitting【Application for approval on budget holder’s behalf
regarding the procurement of goods & services 】 [link:] to the
System Administrator of the ERP System. Although the said
individual may approve the procurement above on ERP system on
behalf of the budget holder, the authority and responsibility for the
procurement is not delegated to the individual but remains at the
budget holder. The individual who approves on budget holder’s
behalf must not approve the purchase requests which are made by
himself/herself (prohibition of self-approval).
28.3.2 Vendor Selection
In principle, selection of vendors by competitive bidding (tender) or other
competitive procedures is required. However, in situations where the
purchase does not exceed 0.5 million JPY, the units and sections may
proceed to vendor selection at their own discretion while maintaining
economic efficiency and fairness. In case that the purchase does not
exceed 5.0 million JPY, the Procurement and Supplies section and the
facility related sections may proceed using one of the following

4
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

competitive procedures
 Estimation of price (0.5 million JPY less than 1.0 million
JPY): the University approved vendors.
 Estimation of price (1.0 million JPY less than 3.0 million
JPY): best value comparative analysis between more than
2 vendors or more.
 Estimation of price (3.0 million JPY less than 5.0 million
JPY): best value comparative analysis based on the official
quotations submitted by 2 vendors or more.
The University can conclude contracts more than 5.0 million JPY without
competitive bidding (tender) procedures subject to approval of the
Procurement Committee in the following cases:
 One vendor only will be able to provide goods, services or
construction, therefore making irrelevant competitive
procedures. This exception must be made by the
Procurement Committee on the basis of justification
including specification and terms and conditions of the
goods, services or construction. The Committee decision is
disclosed on the University website.
 Procurement in emergency situations
 Others stipulated in the Contract Management
Stipulations, Article 31
The Procurement and Supplies Section and the facility related sections
must obtain approval of the approver specified by the PRP26.9
Appendices Table and “Guidelines for Document based Approval
Process” with the justification for the vendor selection, terms and
conditions, and the other necessary information.
Making the intentional split order for adjusting the transaction amount,
for the purpose of avoiding best value comparative analysis and tender,
or of manipulating total amount to be less than 0.5 million JPY, is not
acceptable.

5
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

28.3.2.1 Preparation of Specification document
The University prepares specification document that specifies the
contents and duties clearly, to communicate the contents of the
contract with vendor to ensure the fulfilment of the contract.
The University must obtain the estimation of price after providing
vendors with the specification document. However, when the
purchase does not exceed 1.5 million JPY and the University is able
to specify the contents of the contract clearly without specification
documents, the preparation of specification document may be
omitted.
The specification document must contain the constitution,
demanded performances, delivery date, delivery site, method of
acceptance and inspection, documents (deliverables), warranty, and
the other necessary terms and conditions for the transactions.
In cases of the purchase of research equipment which exceeds 50
million JPY or of Enterprise Systems, the specification documents
must be prepared in compliance with the Bidding and Committees
procedures.
28.3.3 Bidding Process
The University will engage in competitive bidding in a manner that
creates a fair, open, and competitive environment for qualified vendors,
and that secures the best value possible. Methods of competitive bidding
are tender, comprehensive evaluation bidding and other competitive
bidding.
Criterion for determination of successful bidders is the lowest price bid
or the most economically advantageous bid.
28.3.4 Relationships with Suppliers
The University will maintain the highest standards of business ethics and

6
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

conduct when interacting with suppliers. The employees of the University
will build an appropriately competitive environment, considering local
and small businesses, social minorities and environmentally preferred
practices. Persons in charge of units or sections request Procurement and
Supplies Section for credit check

and approval through web portal

[link: ] when starting transactions with new vendor.
28.3.5 Authority for Purchases and Contracts
The Board of Governors has delegated transaction authority for
procurement to various individuals within the University. Only these
individuals are permitted to carry out such delegated transactions. These
individuals must follow the requirements of the policy governing
transaction authority in carrying out such delegated transactions.
Unless delegated (see below), the Procurement and Supplies section and
the facility related sections are authorized and responsible for:


Negotiating all procurement terms and conditions;



Committing funds on behalf of the University to procure
and pay for goods, services or construction, including
equipment; and



Approving the execution of all purchases of goods, services
and construction

28.3.5.1

Delegation

of

Purchasing

and

Contract

Authority
The Procurement and Supplies section may further delegate that
authority to certain individuals for particular transactions
related to their functional responsibilities.

Procurement

delegations must comply with the requirements of OIST
Graduate University PRP Chapter 2.6 and must be approved by
a Vice President at a level above the employee seeking to delegate

7
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

procurement authority.
The delegation must contain the specifics of the delegation,
including the scope, reason, and time limit for the delegation.


The Procurement and Supplies section must review the
delegation annually to assess the need for continuation of
the agreement and whether any modifications or other
alignment is needed.



Failure of a person in charge of unit and section and their
supervisor to follow University policy may result in
withdrawal of the delegated authority.

28.3.6 Independent Contractors
An independent contractor is an individual or entity engaged to perform
services, mainly as a consultant. Such service providers including
independent contractors are not employees of the University and thus not
managed by University employees.
The University must use an “Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA)”
[link: ] when

receiving services from independent contractor. Before

services commence, the ICA contract must be signed by both the
independent contractor and the University’s representative or the Senior
Level Executives with the appropriate level of contract authority. The
language of the agreement cannot be changed without agreement by the
Procurement and Supplies section.
28.3.7 International Procurement
The University procures goods, services and construction from overseas
based on best value if the procurement costs including indirect costs such
as shipping charge, tariff, etc. are cheaper than domestic procurement
taking maintenance after the procurement into consideration. When the
University procures from new overseas vendors, it must screen

8
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

qualifications for the vendors. The University does not authorize full
payment in advance to the vendors not having the required qualifications.
28.3.8 Payment Methods
The University uses bank transfers by invoice after delivery as its primary
payment method. However, if bank transfer is not possible, a corporate credit
card may be used for a transaction in accordance with PRP 26.3.7. The
University may use advance payment methods for vendors for
construction, international procurement, and other situations stipulated
in PRP 26.3.1.27. Such vendors must meet all screening qualifications.
28.3.9 Blanket Purchase Orders
If individual frequently needs specific supplies or services from the same
supplier, the Procurement and Supplies section may establish a “blanket”
purchase order. “Blanket” purchase orders are established for varying
periods within a fiscal year in principle, and allow the individual to order
directly from the supplier without obtaining quotations each time. This
category includes contract for unit price agreement, and basic contract
agreement for continuous transaction.
28.3.9.1 Multi-year contracts and multi-year valid vendor
selection.
The Procurement and Supplies section and the facility related
sections can conclude multi-year contracts according to its property
and purpose. However, it is stipulated separately about necessary
requisitions for multi-year contract[link:].
In addition, the Procurement and Supplies section and the facility
related sections can accomplish vendor selection by multi-year valid
conditions or procedures. At concluding of contract via such selection
method, the Procurement and Supplies section and the facility
related sections shall take appropriate actions by necessity like

9
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

regularly review for succession of contract etc.
28.3.10 Receipt and Inspection of Deliveries
The Receiving & Inspection Center must confirm receipt of procured
goods and services at the time they are delivered to the University. If the
Receiving & Inspection Center cannot confirm receipt due to a lack of
relevant knowledge or expertise related to the delivered goods and
services, or confirming the receipt of delivery is difficult at the Receiving
& Inspection Center, the Procurement and Supplies section may delegate
the confirmation of receipt to staff having appropriate expertise.
The confirmation of receipt may be substituted by receipt of packing
invoice or photograph when procured goods are delivered to off-campus.
Procurement & Supplies section also confirms the performance of
specialized services such as development of databases, programs, digital
contents etc., by deliverables or service completion report.
Receiving & Inspection Center staff receives all the packages delivered to
Receiving & Inspection Center . To confirm the receipt of procured goods
and services, Receiving & Inspection Center staff may open the delivered
packages without permission of the recipient on the waybill.[link : DFA
site]
Persons in charge of each purchasing unit or section shall inspect the
performance of delivered goods and services, and record it eligibly. Staff
of Receipt & Inspection Center may witness the performance inspection.
Persons in charge of each purchasing unit or section shall keep records of
receipt and inspection on file, and submit the records as necessary.
28.3.11 Emergency Purchase
When an emergency situation occurs, an authorized procurement agent
may make a commitment to a vendor without a formal purchase order.

10
ch28_procurement_en_20180201_ar

Such transactions would include, for example, an unanticipated and
sudden life-threatening or catastrophic event.
Simple urgent matters and/or lack of time for required procurement
procedure are not considered as appropriate reasons in this article.
28.3.12 Record Retention
The Budget Section, the Accounting Section, the Procurement and
Supplies section and the facility related sections must maintain records
of procurement and disbursement transactions routed to their respective
Offices. See also Chapter 12, Document and Record Management.
28.3.13 Correction of order
Persons in charge of units or sections shall reissue an official purchase
order form when modification or correction on the content of original
order is needed.
If modification or correction is needed on the cases which purchasing
units, sections or individuals have made a purchase request to the
Procurement and Supplies Section or the facility related sections, the
requesters should notify the sections in charge of purchase order
immediately.
28.4 Responsibilities

OIST Graduate University
Policies, Rules & Procedures
Authority: Approved by the President

Chapter 29. Travel, Meetings and Related Expenses
29.1 Policy
This Chapter provides basic policies and rules on travel and meeting expenses, and honorarium
for OIST officers and employees, and guest travelers. Travelers must understand all travel
related policies and rules and make business travel expenses reasonable and economical. Once
the travelers finish business travels, travelers must promptly make the settlement of travel
expenses in accordance with the travel expense settlement procedures.
Likewise, to invite guests to OIST, inviters must inform guest travelers of OIST’s policies and
rules on guest travels and their expenses. Inviters must also keep guest travel expenses
reasonable and economical and, once the travels are finished, promptly make the settlement of
guest travel expenses in accordance with the travel expense settlement procedures.
The University’s travel policy (and primary requirement) is that all business travel must be
approved before the traveler leaves for the trip and before any prepayments can be made.
University travelers are expected to spend University funds prudently and plan appropriately
so costs do not exceed budgetary limitations. Business travel expenses will be paid by the
University if they are reasonable, appropriately documented, properly authorized, and within
the guidelines of this policy. See Table [link: 26.9] for details on categories of travel expense
and per diem rates. The traveler should neither gain nor lose personal funds as a result of
University travel.
This Chapter applies to anyone who incurs travel expenses paid by the University regardless
of the source of funds. It aims at providing
•Compliance with Japanese regulations.
•Policies, Rules, Procedures, and Definitions that simplify travel arrangements and
enable the University to manage its planned annual travel budget within available
resources.
•Clear and consistent understanding of policies, rules and procedures for meetings and
travel.
Intentional or frequent disregard for the University's travel policy and procedures may be
considered grounds for disciplinary action, and/or for prosecution in the case of fraudulent
misrepresentation of travel expenses.

Page 1 of 29
ch29_travel –and-meetings_en_20181226_cl

29.2 General Considerations
Departments may impose stricter budgetary controls over travel, meeting and related
expenditures than those required by this policy. The University reserves the right to apply more
stringent requirements on individual travelers.

As a principle, Travel, meeting and related expenditures charged to a sponsored project, or
other funding than subsidies such as gifts or grants should follow the guidelines set forth by
this policy unless the funding organization, donor or grantor imposes greater restrictions or on
the opposite gives more discretion. Proper review of allowable expenses must be made by the
Grants and research Collaborations or the Fundraising Office. [link:].
The University has appointed a preferred travel agency (PTA) to help minimize risks (financial
loss, Duty of Care) and obtain good value for money spent. The PTAs [link: List of PTAs] is
the only agent recommended by the University and should always be consulted before booking
international air travel and other overseas services, except where the use of an alternative
supplier is substantially cheaper, low risk and outweighs the other benefits of using the PTAs.
The PTAs may incur fees depending on the services required and the method of booking, but
overall, should deliver competitive fares and value for money.
Travel to countries for which a travel advisory has been issued by the MOFA of Japan is not
advisable. You may access the list of current advisories at the MOFA website [link:
http://www.mofa.go.jp/index.html].
29.2.1 Travel by Key Staff
Key administrative staff members (those who report directly to the President) should
avoid traveling with colleagues, and under no circumstances will more than three key
staff be permitted to travel together.
29.2.2 Group Travel
The University discourages travel by groups of employees from the same department
or office on the same plane or on extended automobile trips as accidents may result in
injuries to several members of the group and may seriously impair the operation of an
essential University activity. Travelers are expected to use good judgment in this
regard.
29.2.3 Combined Personal & Business Travel
When personal travel is combined with business travel, the employee will be
reimbursed for only the business portion of the trip at the lowest available fare. In some
cases, the costs of a business trip can be significantly reduced by an extension of a day
or two. When such extensions are used for personal purposes, this must be indicated in
the travel request. Use of paid leave while on business travel must be clearly indicated
in travel request, which should be approved by Supervisor in advance.
Page 2 of 29
ch29_travel –and-meetings_en_20181226_cl

29.2.3.1 If a travel itinerary is created to accommodate personal travel, the
traveler must pay the incremental cost of personal business compared with the
same direct itinerary with only business purpose and document the costs
incurred, separating personal expenses from University business expenses.

29.2.4 Expenses Incurred by Accompanying Spouse or Personal Guest
Generally, the expenses of a spouse, family, or other accompanying the business
traveler are not reimbursable.
29.2.4.1 Exceptions may be granted with the approval of the President if one of
the following conditions are met:
• The spouse, family, or other accompanying the business traveler has
significant role in the proceedings; or
• The spouse, or other accompanying the business traveler is involved in fundraising activities.
29.2.4.2 This exception is only available if
• the Spouse or other accompanying guest is registered on the travel request,
• the business purpose for the spouse or other accompanying guest is stated,
and
• the accompanying person’s and business traveler's expenses are clearly
identified and demonstrated on the Authorization for Payment.
29.2.4.3 Exceptions stipulated in Business Travel Support Program for child rearing employees, students, and invited guests [link: https://oist-prodgroups.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/s3fspublic/imce/u100221/The%20Guideline%20of%20Business%20Travel%20Su
pport%20Program.pdf] may be granted with the approval of the Vice President
for Gender Equality and Human Resource Development for the program.
29.2.5 Travel by Non-University Employee
The University's Travel Policy shall be extended to cover external members of the
Board of Governors, Board of Counselors and their Committees when they are
attending scheduled meetings of these bodies or when they are otherwise engaged on

Page 4 of 29
ch29_travel –and-meetings_en_20181226_cl

Air/Hotel Packages should be avoided unless purchased through the University's PTAs.
Receipt requirements are found here (Chapter 29.3.13)[29.3.13.]
29.3.2 Air Transportation
Travelers should use the class of airline accommodations permitted in the
Table[Link;26.9] or lower.
29.3.2.1 EXCEPTIONS
29.3.2.1.1. First class tickets are not permissible for University
employees. See Travel Handbook [Link;] for the details. For other
travelers they may be authorized under exceptional and duly justified
circumstances with prior written approval from the President
29.3.2.1.2 Airfare Upgrades at the expense of the University (i.e.
resulting in a total cost superior to the cheapest airfare in the eligible
class for the direct customary route) is not permitted and will not be
reimbursed. Free upgrades or upgrades paid by the traveler must be
clearly documented as such in the Travel Expense Report.
29.3.2.1.3 Airfare costs in excess of the lowest available commercial
discount airfare or the defined standard (Table [Link:26.9]) airfare are
unallowable. EXCEPTIONS: The lower cost accommodations are not
required if they:
(a) require circuitous routing,
(b) require travel during unreasonable hours,
(c) excessively prolong travel or greatly increase the duration of the
flight,
(d) result in increased costs that would offset transportation savings,
or
(e) be inadequate for the medical needs of the traveler.
29.3.2.2 Purchase Method.
Direct billing to the University through travel agencies and airline companies is
available in order to reduce administrative cost, to minimize out-of-pocket
expenses for travelers, and to prevent fraudulent expense claims. This is
permitted only thorough the suppliers which are determined by the Financial
Management Division.
Direct billing of airfare to the University by PTAs is recommended. This is also
applied for all business travels including guest travels.
29.3.2.3 Insurance
Trip insurance, cancellation insurance: the cost for purchasing this insurance
can be significant and should not be purchased on a regular basis for most
Page 5 of 29
ch29_travel –and-meetings_en_20181226_cl

University travel. The cancellation insurance is not an allowable business travel
expense under this University’s travel policy. If the traveler believes that there
is a relatively high probability that the trip may be cancelled due to
circumstances beyond his/her control, it may be possible to obtain cancellation
insurance at an additional fee.
29.3.2.4 Private Plane or Air Charter
Private aircraft and chartered flights are actively discouraged. Private aircraft
or chartered flights may be justified by extenuating circumstances and require
adequate insurance coverage and the prior written approval of the President.
29.3.2.5 Other Air Travel Constraints

minimized. In most cases, it is less expensive to pay the change fee for a
rebooked ticket than to pay for a fully refundable ticket.
29.3.3 Surface Transportation
The most economical mode of transportation should be used to and from air, bus and rail
terminals. Public transportation and shuttle services should be favored. For domestic
travels, in principle, only single-round trip transportation fares between the airport and
the business destination will be provided even for a travel that includes overnight stay,
in order to simplify calculation for reimbursement. NOTE: Original receipts are required
for reimbursement of taxi, shuttle, bus, or other ground transportation for fares. If a fare
can be substantiated by other tools such as online trip organizer and bus company’s
website, no receipt is required.
Employees traveling to the same location should share ground transportation whenever
possible.
Use of rental car is permitted, only if the cost is less than other available modes of
transportation or if a valid business reason confirmed in advance by senior staff precludes
the use of a more economical mode of transportation.
Reporting Accidents
Accidents involving use of surface transportation during the course of University
business, and especially accidents involving rental, University, and personal vehicles
for University business, must be reported immediately to the proper authorities,
consistent with local/state laws. Supervisor or the University 24-hour emergency
service (+81 (0)98 966 8989 ) must be informed as soon as possible of any such
accident.
29.3.3.1 Rail, buses and commercial vessels
When traveling by rail, bus or boat, the travel fare applicable depends upon the
travelers’ situation and travel location. (Appendices & Table)[link: 26.9]

business will be reimbursed. The traveler must provide a clear
description of the personal and business use (distances and periods).
Damages occurring during the personal use period will be fully charged
to the traveler.

Page 8 of 29
ch29_travel –and-meetings_en_20181226_cl

explored before requesting or accepting a higher rate than the daily lodging
allowance. Please see the table[link: 26.9] for details.
If traveler makes a business trip and shares accommodation with his/her spouse,
family member or partner who is an employee of the University, lodging
allowance is paid to either one person. If actual lodging fee of two persons
exceeds the lodging allowance for one person, the actual difference amount is
paid up to the amount of lodging allowance for the additional one person when
an original receipt is submitted. (See 29.4.1)
29.3.4.2 Guaranteed Reservations
Hotel reservations must always be guaranteed for late arrival. This procedure
protects the traveler regardless of the arrival time at the hotel. If the traveler will

to avoid a penalty.
29.3.5 Registration fees for conferences, meetings, and trainings
Registration fees for conferences, meetings, and trainings are not considered as

29.3.8 Per Diem and lodging allowance
Instead of substantiating actual meal, incidental expense (i.e. tips) and lodging expense
for travel, the traveler may be reimbursed on the basis of a per diem and lodging
allowance.
However, in principle, lodging expenses of guest travelers should be paid by direct billing
or actual cost reimbursement based on an original receipt, up to the amount of the fixed
allowance.
The University does not require prorating of per diem and lodging allowance on travel
days: Per Diem and lodging allowance are paid undivided on the basis of the location
and number of days.
Overnights flights on University business are included in the Per Diem calculation.
29.3.8.1 Adjustments to the Per Diem and lodging allowance
When a conference provides meal(s) or meals are covered by meeting expense,
half of per-diem is paid.
Stays Longer Than 30 Days
The lodging allowance is multiplied by 0.6.
The Per Diem is kept unchanged.
Note 1: When an individual's original estimated travel is for more than
30 days in one location, the reduced rate (0.6 x lodging allowance)
applies from the first day. When an individual in travel status at a
location is granted extension to a trip originally estimated at less than 30
days, the 30-days-or-less rate applies for the first 30 days and the morethan-30-days rate applies from the 31st day through the end of the trip.
The 60% policy is based on the assumption that a long term traveler can
reduce the lodging expenses by renting instead of paying on a day-byday basis.
Note2: if there are any difficulties regarding this payment (such as in a
case where the application of the provision of this paragraph is
unreasonable, etc), the Vice President for Financial Management shall
decide the appropriate amount on a case-by-case basis.

Chapter 34. Compensation
34.1 Policy
The OIST Graduate University administers compensation policies and programs to reflect
the value of job duties and responsibilities and to provide competitive and equitable pay.
The University’s compensation policies are designed to accomplish the following goals:
 Allow the University to attract, retain, and motivate competent employees by
establishing and maintaining a salary structure that is internationally
competitive;
 Promote internal equity and consistency across diverse University functions;

 Uphold transparency and accountability in administrating personnel costs to
funding bodies and general public.
34.2 General Considerations

The compensation policies will be consistent with the Equal Opportunity Policy
1
ch34_compensation_en_20170101_cl

34.2.2 Accountability to General Public
As an entity established by a special Act and initially funded by the Japanese
Government, the University is required to provide salaries that are appropriate to

University studies compensation trends in these job categories (and levels) in order
to determine equitable and consistent rate structures, and to maintain a competitive
position in the job market.
34.3.2.1 Job Classification
All University employee positions (except for those of wage employees
which are defined in 34.3.7[link: 34.3.7]) are separated into job categories

Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement) for 2 (two)
consecutive years at the Annual Performance Evaluation
 The University determines that the employee assigned to
his/her position clearly lacks the necessary qualifications for
the position. This demotion must be reviewed by the Salary
Review Committee.
 An employee fails to meet the University’s performance
standards and the University considers it necessary to
demote him/her as a disciplinary action （PRP38.3.5）
Following demotion, salary will be reduced by a maximum of 10%
of the employee’s current salary.
34.3.2.2 Salary Plan

34.3.2.2.2 The rate range for each level is established and annually
reviewed considering various factors.
34.3.2.2.3 Based on the annual review, changes in rate ranges are
proposed by the Vice President for Gender Equality and Human
Resource Development (VPGEHR) as necessary. With the review
of the SRC established by the CEO/President, these changes are
usually made effective April 1.
3
ch34_compensation_en_20170101_cl

Changes in rate ranges are applied uniformly to all employees in the
range on the day the changes become effective in principle.

annual review of the employee’s performance. The performance of
employees other than Faculty members and researchers is annually
assessed and rated by the Annual Performance Evaluation (APE)
results. [link: 36]
34.3.2.3.2 A “Merit Increase Guideline” that specifies an increase
percent for each performance rating, is proposed annually by the
Vice President for Gender Equality and Human Resource
Development (VPGEHR) and reviewed by the SRC. The Guideline
is set in view of trends in the cost of living, competitiveness of the
job market, University budgets, and other relevant factors.

relevant factors.
34.3.3 Year-End Bonus
Year-End Bonus may be given to a relatively small number of individuals who
made a significant achievement or contribution to the University, based on their
APE. A “Year-End Bonus Guideline,” proposed by Vice President for Gender
Equality and Human Resource Development (VPGEHR) and approved by the SRC,
will specify the percentage of the bonus relative to annual salary, criteria for the

Chapter 36. Performance Evaluation
36.1 Policy
The OIST Graduate University’s Performance Evaluation (PE) program encourages
ongoing communication between supervisors and staff in order to foster performance
improvement and career development. Supervisors are required to hold performance
evaluation discussions with all employees whom they directly supervise. The APE program
is also used in determining salary merit increase.
Excluded from this chapter are the following:
⚫ Faculty Members;
⚫ Researchers;
⚫ Part-time Employees.
36.1.1 Review by the Salary Review Committee: SRC
SRC will review the related guidelines, parameters and scope for the PE.
36.2 Rules
36.2.1 Evaluation Period and Schedules
Performance evaluation is conducted annually to evaluate the employee’s
performance during the previous fiscal year and to set goals for the upcoming year.
The supervisor may conduct a performance evaluation more frequently if it is
deemed necessary.
Performance evaluation schedules are determined each fiscal year by the Vice
President for Gender Equality and Human Resource Development (VPGEHR) and
announced to employees. Generally, supervisors are expected to complete their
evaluation discussions by the middle of March, and the results are reflected in the
salary merit increases in April of the following fiscal year.
36.2.2 Goal Setting and Coaching
At the beginning of evaluation period (normally April every year), employees are
expected to work with their supervisors to develop a set of measurable and
achievable goals that can be worked on during the performance period. Supervisors
are expected to actively engage in providing feedback and coaching based on the
employee’s level of achievement toward each goal.

1
ch36_performance-evaluation_en_20181120_cl

36.2.3 Evaluation Elements
Employee Evaluation is conducted by Performance Evaluation (Evaluation of the
performance delivered by the employee against pre-set annual goals), and Value
Competency relevant to the employee’s job grade will also be taken into
consideration.
Employees are rated for each element and given an overall rating by their
immediate supervisors on the on-line system based on the Employee Evaluation
Implementation Regulations developed separately by the Vice President for Gender
Equality and Human Resource Development (VPGEHR).
36.2.4 Confirmation and Adjustment
Evaluation results are submitted to and confirmed (and adjusted if necessary) by
the Supervisor’s Supervisor (hereinafter as “Certifier”) to ensure fair and consistent
evaluations throughout the organization. The Certifier is usually the supervisor’s
supervisor, designated separately by Vice President for Gender Equality and
Human Resource Development (VPGEHR).
36.2.5 Disclosure of Evaluation Results
Confirmed evaluation results are disclosed to the evaluated employees. Employees
have access to evaluation documents upon request and may make copies.
36.2.6 Merit Increase
Merit increase is a salary increase program designed for permanent increases to
Annual Salaries adjusted by the result of annual review of the employee’s
performance. The performance of employees other than Faculty members and
researchers is annually assessed and rated by the Performance Evaluation (PE)
results.
A “Merit Increase Guideline” that specifies an increase percent for each
performance rating, is proposed annually by the Vice President for Gender Equality
and Human Resource Development (VPGEHR) and reviewed by the SRC.
The Guideline is set in view of trends in the cost of living, competitiveness of the
job market, University budgets, and other relevant factors.
Eligibility. Employees are not eligible for salary increase if:
・ Their salaries are equal to their job level Maximum salary;
・ They have been continuously employed by the University for less than 3
months;
・ They are on Administrative Leave;
・ They have been on leave without pay for a period longer than 9 months during
2
ch36_performance-evaluation_en_20181120_cl

the current fiscal year;
・ They are not subject to the Performance Evaluation, as is the case typically for
Postdoctoral Scholars; or
・ The length of their employment contracts is 1 year or less.
・ Faculty members and PE eligible employees whose age reaches beyond the
following at the beginning of the new fiscal year (as of April 1)
- Faculty Members: 70
- Permanent Employee: 65
- Fixed Term Employee (including Continuing Appointments): 65
A Merit Increase does not guarantee an annual salary increase every year. The
salary may fluctuate depending on the change in the rate ranges, the result of each
employee’s performance review, and other relevant factors.
36.2.7 Year-End Bonus
Year-End Bonus may be given to a relatively small number of individuals who
made a significant achievement or contribution to the University, based on their PE.
A “Year-End Bonus Guideline,” proposed by Vice President for Gender Equality
and Human Resource Development (VPGEHR) and approved by the SRC, will
specify the percentage of the bonus relative to annual salary, criteria for the bonus,
and other relevant matters. Employees who are not eligible for a Merit Increase are
similarly not eligible for Year-End Bonus.
36.2.8 Complaints Procedures
Employees may complain in confidence about the evaluation results through the
Compliant Procedures developed by Vice President for Gender Equality and
Human Resource Development (VPGEHR). Every complaint is taken seriously by
the Gender Equality and Human Resource Development Division.
Any harassment and discriminatory treatment that is in response to the filing of a
complaint is prohibited.

The OIST Graduate University sets expectations for employees on 1) time and attendance
and 2) conduct. Employees are responsible for meeting these expectations, and their failure
to do so will result in the University taking disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal.
The University recognizes that the purpose of discipline in most cases is to help employees
improve time and attendance problems or other inappropriate behavior and actions. The
University ordinarily follows a system of progressive discipline to correct problems.
Employees who fail to correct a deficiency after progressive discipline may be dismissed.
Certain violations and infractions may be ruled sufficiently serious to suspend the normal
progressive disciplinary process. Under these circumstances, any step in the disciplinary
procedure may be used, including dismissal.

by VPGEHR will contact the person within 2 working
days.
39.6.1.3.2 Once it is determined that the complaint is
appropriately filed, the VPGEHR must facilitate
communication about the dispute between the claimant and

39.6.1.4.4 The DRC’s report and the recommendation must be
submitted to the COO. The COO is responsible to determine
the final disposition of the case within 30 working days after
receipt of the DRC’s report and recommendation. If the COO
needs additional time, the period may be extended for
additional 30 working days.
39.6.1.4.5 The decision of the COO become final with
concurrence of the President. Once the final decision has been
implemented, the COO must notify the claimant that the case
is closed. Due to privacy considerations, in some cases, the
claimant may only be notified that the matter has been closed,
without receiving any details of the outcome.
39.6.2 Harassment Resolution Procedures
39.6.2.1 Eligibility. All University employees are eligible to seek
both informal and formal harassment issue resolution. An
employee who makes a claim (claimant) should either seek informal
resolution with the confidential external Respectful Workplace and

consult the VPGEHR [link:39.6.2.3.2].
39.6.2.2 RWAH Hotline
The COO establishes the external Respectful Workplace and AntiHarassment hotline.
The RWAH hotline provides a way to seek consultation or to make a
complaint in Japanese or English that is confidential and separate
from the University. The hotline is answered by experienced and
trained professional mediators who can provide consultation, and if
necessary report the matter to the University to seek a resolution of
the situation. The claimant can choose which mediator to contact
within the hotline.
Hotline in English: 050-5236-2375
Hotline in Japanese: 050-5236-2376
Since the mediators of the RWAH hotline may not immediately be
available to answer the call, voice mail is provided, and they will call
back, in general, within 2 working days of the call.
5

ch39_resolving-complaints-&-disputes_en_20180601_cl

The mediators may also be contacted by email at
oistmediators@yahoo.co.jp, which reaches the mediators
exclusively.
Every effort will be made to protect the privacy of claimants using
the RWAH hotline. Claimants can choose to be anonymous or can
identify themselves.
While every effort will be made to keep the consultation process
confidential to respect the claimant’s desire to remain anonymous,
this cannot be guaranteed under all circumstances. If the matter is
sufficiently serious, the mediator may encourage the claimant to give
his/her name and to allow the mediator to report to the COO or the
VPGEHR [link:39.6.2.2.1 c]. In cases where the allegations involve
bodily harm or other illegal action or present the imminent risk to
the safety or health of the claimant or others at the University, the
mediator may immediately inform the COO and the VPGEHR
[link:39.6.2.2.1 d] even without the consent of the claimant.
39.6.2.2.1 Role of the mediators
The ways in which the mediators provide consultation to the
claimant vary from case to case according to the situation. The
basic process is as follows:
a. The mediators will listen to the complaint and discuss with
the claimant how to resolve the problem.
b. The mediator may also mediate the situation depending on
the circumstances. With the consent of the claimant, the
mediator may contact the claimant’s supervisor, the accused,
the
accused’s
supervisor,
or
the
designated
person/section/division, when the mediator considers such
contact to be useful or effective in resolving the situation.
c. If the complaint contains serious allegations which are
deemed to require the University to investigate and take
remedial action, the mediator may urge the claimant to allow
the mediator to report to the Provost, the COO or the
VPGEHR.
d. In cases where the allegations involve bodily harm or other
illegal action (such as an assault, sexual or otherwise) or
present an imminent risk to the safety or health of the
claimant or others at the University, the mediator may
6

ch39_resolving-complaints-&-disputes_en_20180601_cl

immediately inform the COO and VPGEHR even without the
consent of the claimant.
39.6.2.2.2 Follow-up with the claimant: The claimant will, in
principle, be informed by the Mediator of the outcome in cases
described in b, c, d above when and as appropriate. Due to
privacy considerations, in some cases, the claimant may only be
notified that the matter has been closed, without receiving any
details of the outcome.
39.6.2.2.3. Allegations against the President or a Member of the
Executive: In the case of allegations made against the President,
regardless of the nature of the allegations, the mediators will
report directly to the Chair of the Board of Governors of the
University. In the case of allegations made against a Member of
the Executive including Deans, regardless of the nature of the
allegations, the mediators will report directly to the President.
39.6.2.2.4 Record Destruction: The mediators will routinely
destroy their informal notes containing identifying information
pertaining to claimants who contact the mediators and those
involved in resolving matters brought to the mediators. The only
records maintained permanently contain aggregate statistical
trend information.
39.6.2.3 HR-Level Dispute Resolution
39.6.2.3.1 If an employee making a claim (claimant) believes
that the complaint and dispute on harassment issues have not
been resolved through the confidential External Hotline, the
claimant may contact the Vice President for Gender Equality
and Human Resources (VPGEHR). A claimant may directly
contact VPGEHR without going through the External Hotline.
39.6.2.3.1.1 A confidential email box has been set up to
contact
VPGEHR
to
make
a
claim:
[RWAH.HR@oist.jp]. VPGEHR or a HR staff
designated by VPGEHR will contact the person within
2 working days.
39.6.2.3.2 The VPGEHR conducts an initial investigation and
7

ch39_resolving-complaints-&-disputes_en_20180601_cl

attempts to resolve the complaint. This investigation is
carried out informally and confidentially, and in close
consultation with the claimant.
39.6.2.3.3. Issues that cannot be resolved through the
informal process will be forwarded to a Harassment
Investigative Committee (HIC), which will be established and
convened by the VPGEHR within 15 working days after
forwarding the issues, for resolution.
39.6.2.3.4 The HIC consists of 3 members, one of whom is
designated as chair by the VPGEHR, and a legal counsel
appointed by the General Counsel serving as an observer. An
HR staff member provides secretarial support.
39.6.2.3.5 The HIC conducts an impartial and confidential
investigation/ review to determine the facts and
circumstances of the case, and make recommendations to
resolve the matter. In principle, the HIC should prepare a
written response to the VPGEHR within 20 working days
from the date the HIC first convenes. If additional time is
needed, the VPGEHR must be informed of the expected date
of response.
39.6.2.3.6 A written response to the dispute must be given to
the claimant by the VPGEHR within 10 working days from the
date the HIC report was received by the VPGEHR unless
additional time is needed, in which case the claimant must be
informed of the expected date of response. Due to privacy
considerations, in some cases, the claimant may only be
notified that the matter has been closed, without receiving any
details of the outcome.
39.6.2.3.7 Allegations against the President or a Member of
the Executive: In the case of allegations made against the
President, regardless of the nature of the allegations, the
VPGEHR will report directly to the Chair of the Board of
Governors of the University. In the case of allegations made
against a Member of the Executive including Deans,
regardless of the nature of the allegations, the VPGEHR will
report directly to the President.

40.2 General Considerations
40.2.1 Rationale
The work environment has become increasingly complex and requires continuous
improvement in knowledge, competencies, and skills. At the same time, external
factors, such as changes in laws and regulations, have an impact on OIST Graduate
University policies and how work is done. These changes in job complexity or
external environment require that all those employed at the University have access
to training and a chance to improvement their abilities and gain a shared
understanding of change affecting the University.
40.2.2 Non-discrimination
It is the policy of the University that no employee shall be denied opportunities to

40.3.1.1.1 Each newly hired employee is expected to attend an
orientation session organized by the Training and Education Section
training function.
New employee orientation is a joint effort between the Training and
Education Section training function and the receiving Unit or
Division/Section.

general information about the University, an explanation of its Core
Values, Code of Conduct, and Respectful Workplace Policy, an

ch40_staff-development-and-awards_en_20181120_cl

40.3.1.2.2 Frequently, educational training and development
programs are offered during an employee’s regularly scheduled

programs, other parts of the University may provide training
independent to that provided by the Training and Education Section
training function. In other instances, the specific training is provided
